Module 7: 
1)	Timeline 44 BC: immediate after math of Creaser’s murder: Caesar is assassinated on March 15, 44BC. Octavian accepts Caesar’s will and adoption as heir on May 8, 22BC
2)	Sometime between May and November of 44BC Octavian arrives in Rome
3)	Support of Octavian by moderate Caesarians, including the consuls designate, Pansa and Hirtius, casues trouble for Antony 
4)	Hostility grows between OCtavaian and Antony: Octavian is barred from a senate meting of Nov, 28 44BC, by Antony

a.	Introducing Octavian
1)	Gaius Octavius = Octavian 
2)	Great nephew of Julius Caesar 
3)	Adopted by Caesar as heir
4)	Designated as successor? 
5)	27 BC Octavian “renamed” Augustus as emperpr 
i.	Ascendancy of Octavian 
ii.	Second Triumvirate 
iii.	Civil War with Marcus Antonius 
iv.	Victory Battle of Actium sealed his fate 
6)	Sources: Biased pro-Augustan Propaganda 
i.	We have a problem of historiography and interpretation for this period because both Antony and Octavian engaged in a vicious propaganda war against each other 
ii.	Octavian won and Antony died
iii.	As Augustus, he had his own historians and poets revise his role in history as founder of the Second Triumvirates: ie, he white-washed his past 
iv.	Details have ben exaggerated, or omitted; lies have been promoted where useful 
v.	Even before he defeated Antony, Octavian promoted himself as the standard bearer of the west, and the guardian of all good Roman morals and virtues 
vi.	Octavian portrayed Antony as too eastern, and having succumbed to the charms of a wicked eastern queen, Cleopatra. 
vii.	The propaganda allowed him to declare war not only on Antony, but also on Cleopatra (Egypt) and eventually to celebrate a victory* in a foreign war
viii.	This was good propaganda: The Romans were tiring of civil wars
ix.	As Augustus, Octavian would eventually promote himself as the restorer of peace and the Pax Romana. 
7)	Sources: For the last part of the late Republic 44-31 BC
8)	Main sources: 
i.	Appian’s Civil War: Appian made user of the writings of Asinius Pollio, who has campaigned in the east under Antony 
ii.	Dio Cassius’ History (late 2nd c AD)
iii.	 Cicero’s letters down to his death in 43 BC
iv.	Memories of Augustus De Vita Sua were used by Livy; they are believed to survive in epitomes of the lost books 
v.	Most likely published in the mid 20’s BC, they might have been one of the most revealing texts of Roman history, had they survived 
vi.	Longer than his surviving Res Gesta, the Memoirs seem to date from early in the region when the memory of the civil war was fresh, and the political past of Augustus, might have been an issue
vii.	Existing fragments and testimonia suggest that the De Vita Sua was apologetic in tone 
viii.	Velleius Paterculus (writing at the end of the reign of Augustus also gices a brief account of the period) 
ix.	Plutarch’s depicts Antony’s Parthian campaigns based on the writings of Dellius, Antony’s commander and an eyewitness 
x.	He also used memories of Cleopatra’s own physician, Olympus
xi.	Suetonius’ Augustus, in his Lives of the Caesars
xii.	Res Gestae Divi Augusti: Deeds of the Divine Augustus are more useful for the beginning of the Empire: 
1.	The work was a funerary inscription composed by Augustus; it was a first-person account of accomplishements
xiii.	Quintus Dellius, commanded troops against the Parthians under Mark Antony. Between 41 and 31 BC, Dellius undertook diplomatic missions in the east for Antony. Dellius also acted as an intermediary between Antony and Cleopatra, requesting her to travel to Antony’s headquarters
xiv.	After his defeat at the hands of the Parthians in 34 BC, Dellius was allegedly forced to persuade the Armenian king Artavasdes to marry his (the king’s) daughter to Alexander Helios, Antony’s son with Cleopatra. As one of Antony’s commanders in the Parthian War, Dellius wrote a history of the campaign, of which fragments are preserved, including in Plutarch 
xv.	Politically, Dellius was famously known as a feckless charlatan or a flip flopper: thus, he was called desultory bellorum civium, ( a desultory is one who leaps from horse to horse, a term used to refer to circus performers and chariot riders). In this case Dellius is qualified as a leaper of civil wars because in 43 BC he switched his allegiance from P.Cornelius Dolabella, a Casarian, to G. Cassius (one of the assassins of Caesar); then in 42 BC he went over to the Second Triumvirate, first to Antony and finally, immedidately before the Battle of Actium (31), to Octavian, to whom he betrayed information about Antony’s troops 
9)	Damage control: Clean-up
i.	After Caesar’s death Anthony steeped in and took over 
1.	He maintained ht eloyalty of Caesar’s troops 
2.	He went to Caesars’s house and obtained his private papers and his will from Caesar’s widow, Calpurnia 
ii.	Antony held a series of meetings with the assassins and the Caesarians 
1.	They mediated and reconciled the two sides 
2.	The Senate agreed on the following terms: 1. A nameless bill was proposed by Antony and carried into law by the consul designate, G. Vibius Pansa; it stipulated that: a. Caesar would be mourned officiallt by the state b. His reforms would remain intact, valid (they were ratified and carried into law) c. The dictatorship was to be abolished
3.	The conspirators, G.Cassius Longinus and M.Junius Brutus were sent east to Asian Minor ostensibly to govern provinces and overs the important of grain . The real reason was to get them out of Rome before the funeral, to avoid violent clashes between the Caesarians and the Republicians 
10)	Servilla Caepionis was the mistress of Julius Caesar, mother of Brutus, mother-in-law of Cassius, and half-sister of Cato the Younger. She was instrumental in estabilishing détente between Caesarians and Republicans in the aftermath of Caesar’s assassination 
11)	Asinius Pollio was also involved in the political negatiations after the death of Caeasr in 44 BC, which brough Mark Antony to power. In addition, as consul in 40 BC, Pollio was involved in negotiations between members of the Second Ttiumvirate. Pollio also continued to write his Historiae (Histories 6d) about the campaigns of Antony in the east against the Parthians, and the civil was until the end of the Republic 
12)	Antony opened the will on the day of the funeral. He realized the chief beneficiary was not himself, but an obscure grand nephew of Caesar by the name of Gaius Octavius, or Octavian. 
13)	Although he was not mentioned in Caesar’s will, never theless Antony began laying plans to consolidate his power. He still held Caesar’s privat funds and his legions 
14)	Antony made Dolabella, who had been suffet consul, his consular colleague
15)	Antony made Lepidus the Pontifes Maximus and sent him to Spain to deal with the surving sone of Pompey, Sextus, who was threatening Caesar’s governors in western Spain. After Caesar’s death, Lepidus had turned an offense committed by Antony against Caesar, in antony’s favor, and was thus rewarded, by being made Pontifex Maximus by him
16)	Caesar’s will provided for the following provincial allotments: 
i.	Syria was allotted to Publius Dolabella, a Caesarian partisan and commander 
ii.	Cisalpine Gual was allotted to Decimus Brutus, a Caesarian legate, obscure cousin of M.Junius Brutus, and fellow conspirator 
iii.	Asian was to go to Gaius Trebonius another former Caesarian legate, partisan and also a conspirator 
iv.	Macedonia was allotted to Antony, although he remained in Rome at this time 
v.	Antony used Caesar’s veterans to keep peace, suppress ritos, act as his bodyguard, and intimidate the senate 
17)	Over the course of 44 BC Antony realized he would need more miltary power and a provincial governorship to keep himself in proconsular imperium after his consulship ran out. Consequently, he tried to carry a bill into law in the senate to get a commission and a province. It was probably at this point in autumn of 44 BC that Octavian showed up in Rome, and his support by moderate Caesarians began to trouble Antony
18)	Octavian was from an equestrian banking family in Velitrae. He was born in 63 BC [the year of Cicero’s consulship] and brought up by his mother Atia, Julius Caesar’s niece. He was in Apollonia studying rehetoric when he learned that Caesar has been assassinated, and that he was named as the chief heir to Caesar’s estate. Sometime after this, he set out (against his family’s advice) for Italy to claim his inheritance, arriving in Rome in the autumn of 44 BC. Before he entered the city of Rome, Octavian consulted with Caesarian partisans and the two consuls designate, Vibius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius. When Octavian confronted Antony in Rome, he was rebuffed. Octavian used his own resources to pay off Caesar’s legacies. Antony had spent the money in Caesar’s will. Octavian used the extra money from Caesar’s other funds in Brundisium and Albania, which had been allocated for future campagins against the Parthians. 
19)	To please the urban proletariat Octavian put on lavish games and entertainments. To win the support of Caesar’s troops from Antony’s side to his side he paid them double wages out his own pocket. In the manner of a true dictator and a demagogue, Octavian has gained an enormous military power base. An intimidated senate granted him: 1. A future place in the senate, 2. A command with pro-praetorian imperium 3. A future consulship 
b.	Siege of Mutina: 44 BC intoductin Decimus Junius Brutus versus Mark Antony 
1)	By spring of 44 BC the position of the conspirators was starting to be threatened by Caesar’s assassination because Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus wanted the murderers of Caesar to be put on trial 
2)	In March Decimus Junius Brutus’s province of Cisalpine Gual, which had been allocated to him by Caesar was opposed by Antony, who knew that when his consulship ran out, he would need troosp
3)	At first the senate has ordered Decimus Brutus to surrender his province to Antony; the senate was probably coerced by Antony, and his authority as Caesar’s consular colleague
4)	However, Brutus refused and consequently Antony decided to seize it in any case: eliminating Brutus would lead to Antony’s control of the province’s armies 
5)	From January to April of 43BC, Antony laid siege to Mutina the capital of Cisalpine Gual to obtain troops and acquire power, now that his consulship had just expired 
6)	With the arrival of Octavian the previous year, Rome had also become unbearable for Antony; desperate, he now determined to use military force to expel Decimus Brutus from his province; when Brutus refused to leave, Antony, now with Marcus Lepidus’ help, began to lay siege to Mutina, where Brutus’ troops were stationed. Predictably, Cicero encouraged Decimus Brutus to flight and defeat the Caesarians for the restoration of the republic; however, the senate also recognized the threat, and eventually authorized Decimus Brutus to wage war against Antony with the help of the consular legions. Consequently, early in 43 Decimus Brutus began planning for the defense of Mutina, against a long siege by Antony; Antony blockaded Decimus Brutus’ forces and planned to starve them into submission. 
7)	In Jan, 43 BC the senate commissioned the consuls for 43 Aulus Hirtius ( the former to officer of Caesar who wrote the Bellum Alexanderinum) and Gaius Vibius Pansa to march to Mutina to raise the siege and relieve Decimus Brutus; the senate also gave Octavian pro-praetorian imperium to campaign with Pansa in Cisalpine Gaul with Caesar’s armies. Hirtius made preliminary advances to Cisalpine Gual with Octavian, who was still trying to leave an opening for Antony in his plans; Pansa remained in Rome to raise more troops, ratifying laws of Caesar and carrying a law to abolish the office of dictator. The first battle occurred on April 14 in the Forum Gallorum near Mutina: Antony defeated the forces of Octavian and Pansa, and Pansa died; however, Antony was subsequently defeated in a surprise attack from Hirtius. The second battle occurred at Mutina on April 21: the forces of Octavian and Hirtius defeated Antony, but Hirtius died; at this point Antony and Lepidus withdrew from Cisalpine Gual and fled to Transalpine Gaul. We don’t hear much about Decimus Brutus’ role in the battles, except that when he thanked Octavian, after the second conflict, Octavian replied he had come to oppose Antony, not to aid Caesar’s murderers. 
8)	The senate was intimidated by Octavian, but it also needed his legions to deal with Antonty; consequently, the senate yield to Octavian’s demands, promising him authority that it would latter try to repudiate and at the same time unwittingly legitimizing him. 
9)	Later in April of 43, after the defeat of Antony in Mytina, the senate repudiated the promises it has made to Octavian when he arrived in Rome; in addition, the senate decreed the following terms: 
i.	Declared Antony and Lepidus enemies of state 
ii.	Bestowed military honors and new commands on tyrannicides Marcus Junius Brutus and Cassius Longinus for having defeated anti-Roman forces in Syria. 
iii.	Gave Decimus Junius Brutus a military and command of the senatorial armies for his victory over Antony. 
iv.	Snubbed Octavian, and did not give him a triumph, only a minor ovation. 
v.	Repudiated Octavian’s promised consulships and provision of lands for Caesar’s veterans. 
10)	By August of 43 BC: the deaths of the two consuls, the award of a mere ovation and the repudiation of the promises made by the senate, led Octavian at this point to send a delegation of soldiers to re-demand a consulship from the senate. When the senate objected, Octavian now marched on Rome and coerced the senate into giving him and his obscure and elderly cousin, Quintus Pedius a consulship. In September 43 the senate gave Octavian a consulship and promised a consulship for 42. It gave the same to Quintus Pedius, who would be his consular colleague. Octavian also coerced the senate into passing a law to ratify his adoption by Caesar posthumously as his son; and at Octavian’s direction, another law known as the Lex Pedia, was passed by Pedius to prosecute the tyrannicides for treason, effectively making them outlaws of the state. 
11)	The Senate has underestimated Octavian’s determination and nerve; Octavian was not yet twenty. In addition, this miscalculation has driven Octavian into the arms of Antony and Lepidus. In September of 43 BC, as consul Octavian: 
i.	Raided the treasury to pay his troops 
ii.	Instituted a special court to prosecute Caesar’s murderers
iii.	Revoked the senatorial decree against Antony and Lepidus; ie: he restored them now that they were “on his side”
12)	By incredible nerve Octavian had built up a formidable power base. In addition, by highlighting his descent from Caesar, Octavian has obtained the support not only of Caesar’s troops, but also of the masses. 
13)	Formation of Second triumvirate Novermber of 43 BC. Gauis Octavius, Marcus Antonius and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Octavian has acquired official recognition, consolisated his power and ensured his dominance. In Novermber 43 BC Octavian summoned Antony and Lepidus to meet him on a small river island near Bononia. There the three men made peace and divided to form a political coalition for their mutual benefit. They appointed themselves Triumviri with imperium for five years to legislate, command armies and choose magistrates and governors. 
14)	In November 43 BC Octavian, Antony and Lepidus met in Bononia and established the alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. Octavian abdicated his consulship and extended consulships to Marcus Lepidus and Munatius Plancus for 42. It was Caesar who has designated Munatius Plancus as consul for 42. Then the Triumviri announced that they would to impose proscriptions on their enemies; the news of proscriptions led to a wave of panic, and Q.Pedius died of exhaustion when he tried to allay the fears of the people following the announcement. On November 27th of 43 the tribune Titius carried a bill to ratify the Second Triumvirate and extend the alliance until 38 BC. 
15)	He even forced the senate to allow him to put up an equestrian statue of himself in the forum. Thanks to Caesar, the way was now clear for men with power to portray themselves on coinage and in other public contexts. Prior to Caesar, one had to be dead to be on coins. 
16)	Unlike the First triumvirate, which was an informal coalition, the Second Triumvirate was “official” if not constitutional and legitimate. It was mandated by a law, the Lex Titia, carried in the Concilium plebis by a tribune for 43 BC, Publius Titius. 
17)	The fate of Decimus Junius Brutus 
i.	In September of 43 BC Decimus Brutus was declared an enemy of the state thanks to the Lex Pedia. With Cicero’s support, Decimus Brutus crossed the Alps to join Munatius Plancus in his province of Gallia Comate and command with Plancus against Antony; Decimus Brutus’ own forces has deserted him and gone over to Octavian, when he fled Cisalpine Gual. Unfortunately for Decimus Brutus, Munatius Plancus also deserted him: he switched sides and went over to Antony. Decimus Junius Brutus hoped to flee to Macedonia, where Marcus Junius Brutus and Cassius Longinus were stationed with their legions; however, he was executed en route in mid-September by a Gallic chief and agent of Mark Antony. 
18)	Lucius Munatius Plancus survived the civil conflict to hold his promised consulship in 42 BC. Munatius Plancus was a legate of Caesar in Gaul and fought for Caesar in Civil War in Spain and Africa. He was also part of Caesar’s inner circle. At the news of Caesar’s death, Munatius Plancus left Rome for his province of Gallia Comata, which Caesar has allotted to him, where he had five legions. Munatius Plancus founded colonies Caesar had planned in Gaul: Lugdunm and Augusta Raurica. In the dispute between Mark Antony and the Senate he first fought against Antony and against Lepidus, and he united his army with the army of Deciums Junius Brutus. But when Decimus Brutus was declared an enemy by the Lex Pedia he turned to Antony and Lepidus, on whose side he also took part in negotiations at Bononia; in Rome in Dec of 43 he celebrated a triumph over Gauls and in 42 he was consul. 
19)	Octavian’s Partisans: Octavian built up a faction of supporters, including three equestrains: 
i.	Salvidienus Rufus, military commander and advisor. 
ii.	Vipsanius Agrippa, military commander and engineer 
iii.	Gaius Maecenas, who sponsored Octavian’s propagandists as their patron 
20)	Salvidienus was a Roman equestrian, friend of Octavian and his principal commander before Agrippa; an officer in Caesar’s army, Salvidienus was in Appollonia with Octavian in 44, and was Octavian’s first adviser after Caesar’s death. In 42, as a legate for the Triumvirate, he repelled the landing of Sextus Pompeius at Rhegium, but failed to take the headquarters of Sextus and the Republicans. In 41, he commanded legions against the opposition in the Perusine War, with Publius Ventidius and Asinius Pollio. Octavian made Salvidienus governor of Gual in 40 and consul for 39, although he had never help senatorial office. However, Antony revealed to Octavian Salvidienus’ involvement in secret negotiations concerning the Peace of Brundisium, which led to his conviction of treason by the Senate, and his suicide or death
21)	Gaius Maecenas was born in 70 BC in Arretium, about 90 miles north Rome, and was one of Octavian’s closest supporters. He was a descendant of the Etruscan Clinii, a noble and wealthy family of equestrian status, from whom he inherited his fortune; however, he owed his political and social success to Octavian; and although he was never a Senator or a magistrate, he was an important diplomatic and private minister for him and served as an intermediary. In the orbit of diplomacy and statecraft, Maecenas’s first success for Octavian was the negotiation of his marriage with Scribonia, a relative of Sextus Pompeius, in 41 BC, thus forging a political alliance; Maecenas was also present at the negotiations between Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in 40 and at Tarentum in 37. Maecenas took part in the Siege of Mutina in 43 BC and fought on the side of the Triumvirate in the battle of Philippi in 42. From 40, Maeccenas was entrusted by Occtavian with series of important missions, and from 36 BC he represented Octavian in Rome, with unlimited authority; in the years just before Octavian’s elevation to the throne, Maecenas administered Italy and Rome while Octavian was abroad, fighting against his enemies. When Octavian was emperor, Maecenas was one of his most trusted advisors. 
22)	Maecenas is best known for his role as patron and supporter, on behalf of Octavian, of a circle of writers, mostly who promoted Octavian’s social programs and regime. The so-called Circle of Maecenas, included Virgil, Horace, and Propertius, who were among the most famous poets of their day. They and Virgil particularly were invested with writing restoration propaganda, celebrating the cultural rehabilitation of Rome and a new era of peace after generations of civil war. In sum, Maecenas had an important impact on literature through his patronage of these contemporary poets, whom he encouraged to write for the glory of the social and cultural programs of the Octavianic and subsequently the Augustan imperial regime. It would be an oversimplification to qualify these writers were mere propagandists because their writing are considered to be great works of literature; it is however, important to consider them in terms of their socio-political meaning and purpose, and in the context of their period.
23)	Agrippa was from a provincial family of equestrian status, believed to be from Illyria. He was raised with Octavian in Rome, through whom he obtained a pardon from Caesar for his brother, who had fought under Cato in the Battle of Thapsus (Nic. Damas. FGrH II A no. 90). At the end of 45 he went with Octavian to Apollonia (Suet. Aug. 94, 12) and to Rome with him after Caesar’s murder in 44. He may have been Tribune of the Plebs in 43 BC (Serv. Aen. 8, 682). In 42 Agrippa fought in the Battle of Philippi against the tyrannicides, and in 41 he relieved Salvidienus Rufus by occupying Sutrium (App. B Civ. 5, 122) in the Perusine War. In 40 as praetor urbanus; he held off the forces of Lucius Antonius (Antony’s brother and enemy of the Triumvirate) from Perusia (App. B Civ. 5, 140). When Octavian closed the doors of Brundisium to Mark Antony, and he attacked the town, Agrippa overcome his troops (Cass. Dio 48, 28, 1; App. B Civ. 5, 244); when civil war between M. Antony and Octavian seemed imminent, he negotiated (with Maecenas) the Treaty of Brundisium (schol. Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 27), and (again with Maecenas) in 37 the Treaty of Tarentum. (Plut. Ant. 35).
24)	Agrippa was taken to Rome and raised in Caesar’s house as a pignus, a hostage taken as a pledge or guarantee to ensure that Julius Caesar’s adversaries complied with his terms of surrender and obeyed his mandates; the Romans routinely took pledges (pignora pl.), who were often the young children of their defeated enemies and adversaries. Nicolas of Damascus tells the story of Octavian and the pardon for Agrippa’s brother (7): “After finishing that war also, Caesar returned to Rome, having granted pardon to a very few of the captives who fell to him because they had not learned wisdom in the earlier wars. Then the following incident occurred: there was a particular associate and friend of Octavian, Agrippa, who had been educated at the same place and who was a very special friend of his. His brother was with Cato and treated with much respect; he had participated in the Libyan War but was at this time taken captive. Although Octavian had never yet asked anything of Caesar, he wanted to beg the prisoner off, but he hesitated because of modesty and at the same time because he saw how Caesar was disposed toward those who had been captured in that war. However, he made bold to ask, and had his request granted. Thereupon he was very glad to have rescued a brother for his friend and he was praised by others for using his zeal and right of intercession first of all for a friend's safety.”
25)	Octavian and Antony planned to campaign against the tyrannicides in the eastern Mediterranean in 42 BC; consequently their provincial allocations were immediately established so they could recruit troops
i.	Antony was allocated Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul. 
ii.	Lepidus was allocated Gallia Comata (Outer Gaul, * which was still wild, unpopulated, and undeveloped), as well as the two provinces of Spain. 
iii.	Octavian, who was the most dominant member of the Triumvirate, (with the resources of Caesar) was to govern North Africa, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. The Triumviri were to “share” Italy, but Octavian would really control it. Some parts of Italy had already been seized illegally by Sextus Pompeius, the younger son of Pompey, who had survived the Battle of Munda, and as an optimaris republican became an enemy of the Triumvirate.
26)	Timeline 43 BC Siege of Mutina
i.	From January to April of 43 BC, Antony laid siege to Mutina to obtain troops and acquire power, now that his consulship has expired. Decimus Brutus tried but ultimately failed to defend his province first from Antony and subsequently from Octavian and Antony who joined forces during the hostilities and by November had made an alliance. 
ii.	In April of 43 BC Octavian, and the consuls, Gaius Vibius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius (an officer of Caesar who had written the Belleum Alexandrinum commanded against Antony. 
iii.	In August of 43 BC Octavian sent a delegation of his soldiers to negotiate with the senate, and when that failed, he marched on Rome and demanded a consulship. 
iv.	In Sept. of 43 BC the senate complied, gave him a (suffet) consulship for the remainder of the year and a consulship (for 42 BC); the senate also allows his obscure and elderly cousin Quintus Pedius to be his suffet consular colleague. 
v.	In Nov. of 43 Octavian formed the Second Triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus; he renounced his consulship (suffet and future) and gave it to Marcus Lepidus (to hold in 42BC). 
vi.	In November of 43 Quintus Pedius died; Octavian allowed Lucius Munatius Plancus, whom Caesar had designated as consul (for 42 BC) to take Pedius’ place. 
vii.	Decimus Brutus, to whom Caesar had promised a consulship (for 42 BC) had been executed by Antony’s armies in Cisalpine Gaul after defeat by Octavian in April of 43 BC
27)	Florus Epitome of History II: the war around Mutina 
i.	“The first cause of civil dissension was Caesar's will; for his second heir, Antonius, furious because Octavius had been preferred to himself, had engaged in an implacable war to prevent the adoption of that high-spirited youth. 
ii.	Looking upon Octavius, who was under eighteen years of age, as a lad of tender years and a fit and easy victim of injustice, and upon himself as enjoying all the prestige of his long service with Caesar, Antonius proceeded to destroy his inheritance by embezzlement, to pursue him with personal insults, and to hinder his adoption into the Julian family by every device in his power. 
iii.	Finally, he took up arms openly with the object of crushing his youthful rival and, having formed an army, besieged Dec. Brutus, who, in Cisalpine Gaul, was opposing his movements. 
iv.	Octavius Caesar, however, winning popularity from his youth, his wrongs, and the dignity of the name which he had assumed, recalled the veterans to arms, and - what is scarcely credible - though he was holding no office, attacked the consul ( = Antony cos in 44 BC). 
v.	He released Brutus by relieving Mutina and captured Antonius' camp. On this occasion indeed, he also showed his gallantry by an act of personal courage; for, though bleeding and wounded, he took an eagle from the hands of a dying standard-bearer and bore it back upon his shoulder to the camp.”
28)	Florus Epitome of History: on the Formation of the Triumvirate 
i.	“Although Antonius by himself was a sufficient menace to peace and to the State, Lepidus joined him and thus, as it were, added fire to fire. What could be done against two consuls and two armies? Caesar* was forced to become a party to a horrible compact. The three leaders were as different in their aims as in their characters. 
ii.	Lepidus was actuated by a desire for wealth, which he might expect to gain from confusion in the State; Antonius desired vengeance upon those who had declared him an enemy; Caesar was spurred on by the thought that his father's death was still unpunished and that the survival of Cassius and Brutus was an insult to his departed spirit. 
iii.	Under a compact for these objects, peace was concluded between the three leaders. At the junction between Perusia and Bononia they joined hands, and the armies saluted one another. The formation of the triumvirate followed a bad precedent, and with the overthrow of the constitution by arms, the Sullan proscription came back. Its most remarkable act of atrocity was the murder of as many as a hundred and forty senators. 
iv.	Shocking, brutal and pitiable deaths in every part of the world awaited those who escaped. What lamentation can do justice to the disgrace involved in the proscription by Antonius of his uncle Lucius Caesar, and of his brother Lucius Paulus by Lepidus? 
v.	It had long been customary to expose on the rostra at Rome the heads of those who had been executed; but, even so, the citizens could not restrain their tears when they saw the severed head of Cicero on those very rostra which he had made his own, and men rushed to gaze upon him as once they were wont to crowd to listen to him. 
vi.	These crimes were the result of the proscription-lists of Antonius and Lepidus; Caesar** contented himself with proscribing his father's murderers, for fear lest his death might be considered to have been deserved if it had remained unavenged.”
29)	Per. 117 44 BC 
i.	[117.1] Gaius Octavius arrived from Epirus (he had been sent there in advance by Caesar to wage war in Macedonia), and after all kind of favorable signs, he accepted the name of Caesar. 
ii.	[117.2] In an atmosphere of confusion and disturbance, Marcus Lepidus accepted the office of pontifex maximus. 
iii.	[117.3] The consul Mark Antony recklessly tried to dominate the stage and carried a law concerning changes in the assignment of provinces by violence 
30)	Per. 118 44 BC [118.2] 
i.	The Senate gave Gaius Caesar, who as a private citizen had built an army, the powers of a propraetor and the ornaments of a consul and promised that he would be made senator. 
ii.	[118.3] Mark Antony besieged Decimus Brutus at Modena, and the envoys sent by the Senate to negotiate peace were unsuccessful, 
iii.	[118.4] so the Roman people accepted the military dress. 
31)	From the Summaries (Periochae) of Livy Books 119-120 (43 BC) 
i.	[119.3] After Pansa had unsuccessfully fought against Antony, Hirtius arrived with his army, defeated the troops of Antony and brought the fortunes of both sides in balance again. 
ii.	[119.4] Antony, defeated by Hirtius and by Caesar (Octavian) fled to Gaul, where he joined Lepidus and the legions under his command; the Senate declared him and every soldier in his army an enemy. 
iii.	[119.5] Hirtius, who had been killed in the camp of the enemy after his victory, and Pansa, who had died from wounds received during his defeat, were buried on the Field of Mars. 
iv.	[119.6] The Senate was hardly grateful to Caesar (Octavian), who was the only one of the three leaders to survive: it voted a triumph to Decimus Brutus, who had been freed from the siege of Modena by Caesar (Octavian) and made no satisfying reference to Caesar (Octavian) or his army. 
v.	[119.7] Therefore, Caesar (Octavian), on advice by Lepidus, reconciled himself with Antony, marched on Rome with his army, and, surprising everyone who was against him, was made consul at the age of nineteen. 
vi.	[120.1] As consul, Caesar (Octavian) carried a law to prosecute those who had been involved in the murder of his father, Julius Caesar; under the terms of this law, Marcus Brutus, Gaius Cassius, and Decimus Brutus were condemned in their absence. 
vii.	[120.3] Caesar (Octavian) made his peace with Antony and Lepidus. For five years, they were to be triumvirs for the restoration of the republic, and their opponents were to be proscribed. 
32)	Cassius Dio 44. 53 
i.	“These were the actions of the consuls and of the others at that time. I say consuls, for Antony, fearing that Dolabella would head a revolt, took him as his colleague in the consulship, although he was at first not disposed to do so, on the ground that the office did not yet belong to him. 
ii.	When, however, the excitement subsided, and Antony himself was charged with the duty of investigating the acts of Caesar's administration and carrying out all his behests, he no longer acted with moderation, but as soon as he had got hold of the dead man's papers, made many erasures and many substitutions, inserting laws as well as other matters. 
iii.	Moreover, he deprived some of money and offices, which in turn he gave to others, pretending that in doing so he was carrying out Caesar's directions. Next, he seized large sums of money there in Rome, and collected large sums also from private persons, communities, and kings, selling to some land, to others freedom, to others citizenship, to others exemption from taxes. 
iv.	And this was in spite of the fact that the senate had voted at first that no tablet should be set up on account of any law alleged to have been framed by Caesar (all such matters were inscribed upon bronze tablets), and that later, when he persisted, declaring that many urgent matters had been provided for by Caesar, it had ordered that all foremost citizens should jointly determine them. 
v.	Antony, however, paid no attention to them, and, in a word, despised Octavius, who, as a stripling and inexperienced in business, had declined the inheritance because it was trouble-some and hard to manage; and thus, he himself, claiming to be the heir not only of the property but also of the power of Caesar, managed everything. One of his acts was to restore some exiles. 
vi.	And since Lepidus had great power and was causing him considerable fear, he gave his daughter in marriage to this leader's son and made arrangements to have Lepidus himself appointed high priest, so as to prevent his meddling with what he himself was doing. 
vii.	In fact, in order to carry out this plan with ease, he transferred the election of the high priest from the people back to the priests, and in company with the latter he consecrated him, per-forming few or none of the prescribed rites; and yet he might have secured the priesthood for himself.” 
33)	Timeline 43 BC Siege of Mutina (Cisalpine Gaul) and ascendancy of Octavian 
i.	From January to April of 43 BC, Antony laid siege to Mutina to obtain troops and acquire power, now that his consulship has expired. Decimus Brutus tried but ultimately failed to defend his province first from Antony and subsequently from Octavian and Antony who joined forces during the hostilities and by November had made an alliance. 
ii.	In April of 43 BC Octavian, and the consuls, Gaius Vibius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius (an officer of Caesar who had written the Belleum Alexandrinum commanded against Antony. 
iii.	In August of 43 BC Octavian sent a delegation of his soldiers to negotiate with the senate, and when that failed, he marched on Rome and demanded a consulship. 
iv.	In Sept. of 43 BC the senate complied, gave him a (suffet) consulship for the remainder of the year and a consulship (for 42 BC); the senate also allows his obscure and elderly cousin Quintus Pedius to be his suffet consular colleague. 
v.	In Nov. of 43 Octavian formed the Second Triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus; he renounced his consulship (suffet and future) and gave it to Marcus Lepidus (to hold in 42BC). 
vi.	In November of 43 Quintus Pedius died; Octavian allowed Lucius Munatius Plancus, whom Caesar had designated as consul (for 42 BC) to take Pedius’ place. 
vii.	Decimus Brutus, to whom Caesar had promised a consulship (for 42 BC) had been executed by Antony’s armies in Cisalpine Gaul after defeat by Octavian in April of 43 BC
c.	Proscriptions and taxes 
1)	43 BC Proscriptions and Revenge 
i.	Late in 43 BC the triumvirs set up proscriptions more brutal than Sulla’s
ii.	The excuse was retribution for Caesar’s murder, but the real reason was to confiscate wealth and property in order to pay off their veterans and raise more troops. 
iii.	The Triumvirs planned to campaign against the Tyrannicides in the east, a political strategy to shore up support from the masses and legions, and bring them wealth 
iv.	They supplemented their proscriptions with heavy taxes on the wealthy 
2)	Death of Cicero 43 BC
i.	Antony proscribed Cicero for the Philippics, a series of 14 speeches Cicero gave condemning him in 44 BC and 43 BC
ii.	Antony’s agents overtook him at Formiae
iii.	Cicero ordered his slaves to flee, and save themselves
iv.	Antony cut off his hands and head 
v.	Hung them up on Rostra of Forum 
3)	Velleius Paterculus
i.	64. 3. “This is the period when Cicero in a series of speeches branded the memory of Antony for all time to come. Cicero assailed Antony with his brilliant and god given tongue, whereas Cannutius, the tribune tore him to pieces with the ravening of a mad dog. Each paid with his life for his defence of liberty. 
ii.	The proscription was ushered in by the slaying of the tribune; it practically ended with the death of Cicero, as if Antony were now sated with blood. 
iii.	The climax of the shame of this time was that Caesar should be forced to proscribe any ne, or that anyone should proscribe the name of Cicero. By the crime of Antony, when Cicero was be-headed the voice of the people was severed, nor did anyone raise a hand in defence of the man who for so many years had protected the interests both of the state and of the private citizen. 
iv.	But you accomplished nothing, Antony-for the indignation that surges in my breast compels me to exceed the bounds I have set for my narrative - you accomplished nothing, I say, by offering a reward for the sealing of those divine lips and the severing of that illustrious head, and by encompassing with a death-fee the murder of so great a consul, and of the man who once had saved the state. 
v.	You took from Cicero a few anxious days, a few senile years, a life which would have been more wretched under your domination than was his death in your triumvirate; but you did not rob him of his fame, the glory of his deeds and words, nay you but enhanced them. 
vi.	He lives and will continue to live in the memory of the ages, and so long as this universe shall endure -this universe which, whether created by chance, or by divine providence, or by whatever cause, he, almost alone of all the Romans, saw with the eye of his mind, grasped with his intellect, illumined with his eloquence -so long shall it be accompanied throughout the ages by the fame of Cicero. All posterity will admire the speeches that he wrote against you, while your deed to him will call forth their execrations, and the race of man shall sooner pass from the world than the name of Cicero be forgotten.”
4)	Plutarch: Death of Cicero 
i.	“While this was going on, Cicero was at his own country seat in Tusculum, having his brother with him; but when they learned of the proscriptions, they determined to remove to Astura, a place of Cicero’s on the seacoast, and from there to sail to Brutus in Macedonia; for already a report was current that he was in force there.
ii.	So they were carried along in litters, being worn out with grief; and on the way they would halt, and with their litters placed side by side would lament to one another. 
iii.	But Quintus was the more dejected and began to reflect upon his destitute condition; for he said that he had taken nothing from home, nay, Cicero too had scanty provision for the journey; it was better, then, he said, that Cicero should press on in his flight, but that he himself should get what he wanted from home and then hasten after him. 
iv.	This they decided to do, and after embracing one another and weeping aloud, they parted. So, then Quintus, not many days afterwards, was betrayed by his servants to those who were in search of him, and put to death, together with his son. But Cicero was brought to Astura and finding a vessel there he embarked at once and coasted along as far as Circaeum with the wind in his favor.
v.	From there his pilots wished to set sail at once, but Cicero, whether it was that he feared the sea, or had not yet altogether given up his trust in Caesar, went ashore and travelled along on foot a hundred furlongs in the direction of Rome.”
vi.	“But again, losing resolution and changing his mind, he went down to the sea at Astura. And there he spent the night in dreadful and desperate calculations; he actually made up his mind to enter Caesar's house by stealth, to slay himself upon the hearth, and so to fasten upon Caesar (Plutarch is referring to Octavian) an avenging daemon. 
vii.	But a fear of tortures drove him from this course also; then, revolving in his mind many confused and contradictory purposes, he put himself in the hands of his servants to be taken by sea to Caieta, where he had lands and an agreeable retreat in summertime, when the breath of the Etesian winds is most pleasant. 
viii.	The place has also a temple of Apollo, a little above the sea. From thence a flock of crows flew with loud clamor towards the vessel of Cicero as it was rowed towards land; and alighting on either end of the spreader,* some cawed, and others pecked at the ends of the ropes, and everybody thought that the omen was bad. 
ix.	Nevertheless Cicero landed and going to his villa lay down to rest. Then most of the crows perched themselves about the window, cawing tumultuously, but one of them flew down on the couch where Cicero lay with muffled head, and with its beak, little by little, tried to remove the garment from his face. 
x.	The servants, on seeing this, rebuked themselves for waiting to be spectators of their master's murder, while wild beasts came to his help and cared for him in his undeserved misfortune, but they themselves did nothing in his defence. So partly by entreaty, and partly by force, they took him and carried him in his litter towards the sea.”
xi.	Meantime his assassins came to the villa, Herennius a centurion, and Popillius a tribune, who had once been prosecuted for parricide and defended by Cicero; and they had helpers. 
xii.	After they had broken in the door, which they found closed, Cicero was not to be seen, and the inmates said they knew not where he was. Then, we are told, a youth who had been liberally educated by Cicero, and who was a freedman of Cicero's brother Quintus, Philologus by name, told the tribune that the litter was being carried through the wooded and shady walks towards the sea. 
xiii.	The tribune, accordingly, taking a few helpers with him, ran round towards the exit, but Herennius hastened on the run through the walks, and Cicero, perceiving him, ordered the servants to set the litter down where they were. 
xiv.	Then he himself, clasping his chin with his left hand, as was his wont, looked steadfastly at his slayers, his head all squalid and unkempt, and his face wasted with anxiety, so that most of those that stood by covered their faces while Herennius was slaying him. 
xv.	For he stretched his neck forth from the litter and was slain, being then in his sixty-fourth year. 
xvi.	Herennius cut off his head, by M. Antony's command, and his hands, the hands with which he wrote the Philippics. For Cicero himself entitled his speeches against Antony “Philippics,” and to this day the documents are called Philippics.”
xvii.	“When Cicero’s extremities were brought to Rome, it chanced that Antony was conducting an election, but when he heard of their arrival and saw them, he cried out, “Now let our proscriptions have an end.” 
xviii.	Then he ordered the head and hands to be placed over the ships' beaks on the rostra, a sight that made the Romans shudder; for they thought they saw there, not the face of Cicero, but an image of the soul of Antony. However, Antony showed at least one sentiment of fair dealing in the case when he handed over Philologus (the freedman of Cicero’s brother Quintus, who betrayed Cicero) to Pomponia, the wife of Quintus. 
xix.	And she, having got the man into her power, besides other dreadful punishments which she inflicted upon him, forced him to cut off his own flesh bit by bit and roast it, and then to eat it. 
xx.	This, indeed, is what some of the historians say; but Cicero's own freedman, Tiro, makes no mention at all, of the treachery of Philologus. 
xxi.	I learn that Caesar (Octavian), a long time after this, paid a visit to one of his daughter's sons; and the boy, since he had in his hands a book of Cicero's, was terrified and sought to hide it in his gown; but Caesar (Octavian) saw it, and took the book, and read a great part of it as he stood, and then gave it back to the youth, saying: “A learned man, my child, a learned man and a lover of his country.”
xxii.	“Moreover, as soon as Caesar (Octavian) had finally defeated Antony, and when he was himself consul, he chose Cicero's son as his colleague in the office, and it was in his consulship that the senate took down the statues of Antony, made void the other honors that had been paid to him, and decreed besides, that no Antony should have the name of Marcus. And so, the heavenly powers devolved upon the family of Cicero the final steps in the punishment of Antony.” 
xxiii.	The violence of Cicero’s death and sadism of Antony were probably exaggerated; in addition, the story about Octavian visiting Cicero’s grandson was probably made up by Octavian’s apologists, to soften Octavian’s image, diminish his role in the proscriptions and defame Antony after Antony’s death in 31BC, when (obviously) he could not defend himself. In 30 BC Octavian did make Cicero’s son M. Tullius Cicero Minor, his consular colleague.
5)	As Antony’s wife, Fulvia was a victim of Augustan revisionist historiography, which placed the blame on Antony and Fulvia for the atrocities committed by all three triumvirs in the proscriptions. 
6)	Fulvia desecrates Cicero’s corpse
i.	“And Fulvia took the head into her hands before it was removed, and after abusing it spitefully and spitting upon it, set it on her knees, opened the mouth, and pulled out the tongue, which she pierced with the pins that she used for her hair, at the same time uttering many brutal jests.
ii.	Yet even this pair saved some persons from whom they got more money than they could expect to obtain by their death; and in order that the places for their names on the tablets might not be empty, they inscribed others in their stead. Indeed, except for releasing his uncle at the earnest entreaty of his mother Julia, Antony performed no praiseworthy act.
7)	Corruptions 
i.	To give their regime more power, the Triumviri filled the senate with partisans and clients. They also rewarded political allies with magistracies and senate seats. 
ii.	In January of 42 BC, they took office formally (Dio 47. 18. 3). They also forced the senate and the magistrates to swear an oath of allegiance and observe the acts of Caesar. “Thus, on the first day of the year (January 42 BC) they themselves took an oath and made all the rest swear that they would consider all Caesar’s acts binding; and the same thing is still done today in honor of all those who successively enter upon the supreme power and also of those who have possessed it and have not been dishonored.”
8)	Early in 42 BC the triumvirs also imposed a dotal tax (on women’s dowries) for money to wage “war” against the assassins of Caesar. Hortensia gave a speech to the Triumvirate, complaining that the dotal tax was illegitimate because it was intended to fund a civil war.
9)	42 BC Hortensia and Dotal Tax: high-ranking women challenged the rule of Triumvirate 
10)	The proscriptions were not bringing in sufficient funds because the food of seized properties drove down prices 
11)	Many folks were unwilling to buy confiscated properties-taken with no regard for property rights 
12)	The triumvirs modelled the dotal tax on the old dotal tribute, that had been collected by Tertia Ameillia during Second Punic War 
13)	The tax was imposed on the wealthiest women of Rome: a list with 1400 names was posted; fraud would be punishable by fines 
14)	It was a proscription of women without the threat of murder 
15)	It was also devastating for wealthy women who stood to lose assets since property values would plummet 
16)	Hortensia, gave an impassioned speech outlining why the tax was morally questionable 
17)	Valerius Maximus reports her eloquence was equal to that of her father Hortensius, a celebrated orator, and a worthy opponent of Cicero 
18)	As the daughter of a staunch Reoublican, Hortensai also shared the ideology of the proscribed 
19)	Hortensia’s speech is preserved in Appian 4. 32-33. Meaning of Hortensia's Speech? She challenged the tax on the grounds that as women, who had not been proscribed or involved in policy-making, they should not be taxed. She also reminded them that their mothers had contributed to the war chest during the Second Punic Wars indirectly, but on a volunteer basis. She declared the women would contribute to a foreign war chest but not to a civil war chest, a distinction that would have angered the Triumviri since they were fighting a civil war, and the people hated civil wars.
20)	The triumvirs accused the women of holding a public meeting while their, men, serving in armies were silent. They ordered lictors to drive women out of the forum, but the shouts of crowd, including many men forced them to desist. Hortensia’s message was not lost on the men in the crowd: Men had also lost their rights to the tyranny of Triumvirate. The men supported Hortensia and the women, by not allowing the lictors to disperse the female demonstrators. 
21)	In the end, the Triumvirs feared Hortensia because of her outspokenness and her popularity. They understood the political damage they might inflict on themselves with the imposition of a dotal tax on women, as well as the moral dilemma of civil, as opposed to foreign war, underlined by the incident. The Triumvirs backed down, and they reduced the number of taxable women from 1,400 to 400. The Triumvirs made up the difference with a new tax on men, including foreigners.
22)	In 42 BC Octavian also had the Triumvirate deify Julius Caesar so that he could call himself Divi filius, or the son of a god. * This anticipates the subtle development of the cult of the emperor (in an appropriate context for the western empire). The beard in the portrait signifies mourning, although Octavian did not shave until 38 BC, for Livia, his future (and third) wife.
23)	Appian BC 2. 148 
i.	“There (Caesar’s coffin-stand in the forum) an altar was first erected, but now there stands the temple of Caesar himself, as he was deemed worthy of divine honors. 
ii.	For Octavian, his son by adoption, who took the name of Caesar, and following in his footsteps in political matters, greatly strengthened the government which was founded by Caesar, and remains to this day, decreed divine honors to his father. 
iii.	From this example the Romans now pay like honors to each emperor at his death, if he has not reigned in a tyrannical manner, or made himself odious, although at first, they could not bear to call them kings even while alive. ”
d.	Avenging Caesar’s Murder: battle of Philippi 
1)	Battle of Philippi 42 BC
i.	After crushing any resistance in Italy the Triumviri set their sights on the east, and declared war on Cassius and Brutus
ii.	The official casue was to avenge Caesar’s assassination 
iii.	The real cause was to obtain their money and spoils: 
iv.	Cassius and Brutus had accumulated great wealth through the spoliation of the eastern provinces 
v.	Their headquarters were at Philippi 
vi.	Their troops were made up of the remnants of their legions, mercenaries and some veterans of Caesar 
vii.	The battle was decsive in the political war bettern the assaaains of Caesar and the Triumvirs, who prevailed 
viii.	In summer 42 BC, leaving Lepidus in Italy to govern Rome, Antony and Octavian landed in Greece with 19 legions 
ix.	October 42 BC, the armies of Brutus and Cassius, and those of Octavian and Antony approached each other near Philippi, not for form their respective camps 
x.	Brutus and Cassius also had 19 legions, some formerly of Caesar, some mercenaries and veterans 
2)	Battle consisted of two engagements in plains west of Philippi
i.	The first engagement occurred on 3 October: Brutus faced Octavian, while Antony fought Cassius. Brutus pushed back Octavian, entered his camp, and defeated him. However to the south, Cassis was defeated by Antony, but he killed himself after hearing a false report that Brutus had been defeated by Octavian.  
1.	The armies of Brutus and Cassius arrived from the southeast. The armies of Antony and Octavian arrived from the west. Antony offered battle several times, while Cassius and Brutus, better positioned on two hills nw of Philippi for defense, held off. Cassius and Brutus wanted to wait until they had naval reinforcements, anf then defeat the Triumvirs in a naval battle. They also wanted to force the Triumvirs to use up their supplies. Antony tried to circumvent their defenses/camps by building a causeway through the swamp in order to cut off their line of communication, and mount a surprise attack. However Cassius figured this out, led his army south into the marshes, and constructed a cross wall in an effort to flood the area and to cut off Antony’s wing. 
ii.	The second engagement occurred on 23 October: Brutus’ forces were defeated, and Brutus committed suicide, leaving the Triumvirate in control of the Roman empire. 
1.	During the first engagement, the fleet of Brutus intercepted and destroyed the Triumvirs' reinforcements (2 legions and supplies). As a result, Antony and Octavian were now vulnerable: they could not forage and feed their troops, and Brutus now had access to the supplies of the Triumvirs from the sea. Consequently, the Triumvirs had to send a legion south to Achaea (Greece) to collect more supplies. By the second engagement, the troops of both sides were demoralized.* Both Brutus and Octavian were unexperienced commanders. *The prospect of fighting fellow Romans severely diminished morale.
iii.	Brutus had planned to hold off battle, while he was waiting for reinforcements from the navy. However, his left flank was entrapped by Antony, who again advanced secretly from the west through the swamp. Octavian also gave battle from the marshes at the south, surrounding Brutus and preventing any retreat route. Hemmed in and pressed by his men (who were tired, impatient and deserting), Brutus had no choice but to fight. The second engagement involved close combat, face-to-face, which resulted in terrible carnage. The Triumvirs whose troops were better-trained, beat back the Republicans, but there were heavy casualties on both sides.
iv.	Brutus escaped with 4 legions but committed suicide soon after, brirnging the war to a close. 
v.	The fact that the inexperienced Brutus defeated Octavian in the first battle, reveals the latter’s weakness on the battlefield. Military successes Octavian enjoyed were owed to his supporters. 
3)	In sum, the Battle of Philippi was a strange battle: Despite Cassius’ efforts Antony was able to attack, but with great difficulty, (barely) defeating Cassius, who then committed suicide thinking Brutus had been defeated. But to the north, Brutus advanced against the left wing of Octavian’s army, also by surprise; he crushed it, and took control of his camp, forcing him to flee. At the end of the first engagement, both sides had sustained the same losses; the assassins of Caesar might have prevailed, had Cassius not been tricked.
4)	42 BC After defeating Cassius and Brutus, the Triumvirs repartitioned the provinces. 
5)	Antony took all of Gaul except Cisalpine Gaul,* which now became a part of Italy (Rome). 
6)	Antony also inherited all of the eastern provinces, which had previously been occupied by Cassius and Brutus. 
7)	Lepidus, whom Octavian suspected (on trumped up charges) of conspiring with Sextus Pompeius, got nothing. 
8)	Octavian got Italy (Rome), Spain, Sardinia and Africa; he agreed to restore Africa to Lepidus after a period of probation. 
9)	*Octavian made Cisalpine Gaul part of Italy so he (rather than Antony) could recruit troops in this district of Italy, which was now under his jurisdiction.
10)	Having secured control of the east, Antony stayed in the eastern Mediterranean, and until the dissolution of the Triumvirate, was occupied with the campaigns against the Parthians (and occupied with Cleopatra). 
11)	Octavian went back to Italy to disband his troops and find more land, on which to settle his veterans (through confiscations). 
12)	Octavian, the more calculating of the two men, knew that control of Rome and Italy was the key to ultimate supremacy. 
13)	The stage was now set for a division of the Roman empire into a western half under Octavian, and an eastern half under Antony.
14)	Florus Epitome of History II. “War against Cassius and Brutus” 
i.	“Brutus and Cassius seemed to have cast forth Caesar from the throne like another Tarquin; yet by that very act of murder they destroyed that liberty, the restoration of which was their dearest wish.
ii.	After the deed had been committed, being, not without reason, afraid of Caesar's veterans, they had immediately left the senate-house and taken refuge in the Capitol. They were not without the courage to avenge Caesar, but they were as yet without a leader. 
iii.	So, since it was manifest what a calamity was threatening the State, the idea of vengeance was rejected, though the murder met with disapprobation. 
iv.	Therefore, although on the advice of Cicero an amnesty was passed, yet, to avoid offending the gaze of the sorrowful populace, the murderers had withdrawn to Syria and Macedonia, provinces which had been assigned to them by Caesar, the very man whom they had murdered. Thus, revenge for Caesar was delayed rather than stifled. 
v.	The governing power having been distributed between the triumvirs rather as it could be than as it should be, Caesar (Octavian) and Antonius prepared to make war on Cassius and Brutus, while Lepidus remained behind to guard the capital. 
vi.	Brutus and Cassius, having collected vast forces, had occupied the same ground as had been fatal to Pompey (the Great). On this occasion too threatening signs of impending disaster were not lacking.” 
vii.	“A swarm of bees settled on the standards; the birds which usually feed upon corpses flew round the camp, as though it were already their prey. 
viii.	And an Ethiopian who met the troops as they were marching to battle was only too clearly an omen of disaster. Also, while Brutus himself was meditating at night, according to his custom, with a lamp at his side, a gloomy phantom presented itself, and on being asked who it was, replied, “I am your evil genius,” and then vanished from his wondering sight. 
ix.	In Caesar’s (Octavian’s) camp birds and victims had with equal clearness given every promise of better fortune. The most striking incident was that Caesar's physician was warned in a dream that Caesar should quit his camp, which was on the point of being captured. And this actually happened. 
x.	For when the battle had begun and both sides had been fighting for some time with equal ardor and, though on one side both generals were present, on the other side one had been kept away by illness, the other by fear and cowardice, yet the invincible good fortune both of the avenger and of him who was being avenged supported their cause, as the result of the battle proved. At first the issue was so doubtful that, danger threatening both sides alike: 
xi.	The camp of Caesar was captured on the one hand, and that of Cassius on the other. But how much more powerful is fortune than valor, and how true it is, as the dying Brutus said with his last breath, that virtue exists not in reality but in name only! A mistake decided the victory in this battle.” 
xii.	“Cassius, at a moment when the wing of his army had given way, on seeing the cavalry returning at full speed after the capture of Caesar’s camp, thought that they were in flight and made his way to some higher ground. 
xiii.	Here, when the dust and confusion and the approaching darkness prevented him from seeing what had happened, and a scout whom he had sent out to obtain news was slow in bringing it, thinking that his cause was lost, he made one of those, who were standing by cut off his head. 
xiv.	Brutus, having lost his second self by the death of Cassius, in order that he might not fail in carrying out every detail of their compact (for it had been agreed that neither of them should survive the battle), presented his side to one of his companions that he might plunge his sword into it. 
xv.	Who can but wonder, that these wise and brave men did not die by their own hands? But it was perhaps a further example of their adherence to their philosophical principles, that they should not stain their hands with blood, but that, for the destruction of their brave and pious lives, although the decision to die was their own, they should employ the hands of others to execute the crime.”
e.	Perusine “War” Peace of Brundisium  
1)	The Perusine War/War of Perugia: At the end of 41 BC the “War” of Perugia (Perusia in antiquity), aka the Perusine “War” erupted, a puzzling armed conflict that led Antony and Octavian to revise their relationship.
2)	Timeline Perusine War 41-40 BC 
i.	Early in 41 BC the consul, Lucius Antonius (Antony’s brother), incited by Fulvia, (Antony’s wife) takes issue with Octavian's confiscations of lands in Italy, intended for his veterans. 
ii.	After several attempts at mediation (by Octavian’s troops) an armed conflict erupts at the end of 41 BC. 
iii.	Lucius Antonius and Fulvia flee to Praeneste and are besieged by Octavian, who blockades the town. 
iv.	They remain stuck there while waiting for support from a hesitant, confused and inscrutable (ambiguous) Mark Antony. 
v.	Early in 40 BC Octavian besieges the town and sends Lucius out to govern Spain; Fulvia dies en route to Greece to meet (her husband), Antony.
3)	Periochae: Book 125 
i.	[41BC] Caesar (Octavian), leaving Mark Antony overseas (the provinces in that part of the empire had been placed under his command), returned to Italy and gave land to his veterans. 
ii.	At great danger he suppressed rebellions in his army, which certain soldiers, corrupted by Fulvia the wife of Mark Antony, had stirred up against its general. 
iii.	Consul Lucius Antonius, brother of Mark Antony, launched a war against Caesar. 
iv.	The peoples whose country had been given to the veterans, had sided with him, and he defeated Marcus Lepidus, who was responsible for the defense of the city, and forced his way into Rome. 
4)	Periochae: Book 126 
i.	[40 BC] Caesar (Octavian) was only twenty-three when he laid siege to Lucius Antonius in the town of Perugia and prevented several break-outs, and when hunger forced him into surrender, Caesar (Octavian) pardoned him and all his soldiers, but sacked Perugia. Without bloodshed, he brought the armies of both sides in this war under his command.
5)	The Perusine “War” In 41 BC Octavian had started giving land to his vets, to Caesar’s vets and to Antony’s soldiers to win them over to his side, but it had proven to be a greater problem than he had envisaged (App. BC 5. 1. 3). The Italians who were living in the municipal towns were angry about the confiscations, as they increased to accommodate demand. The urban proletariat of Rome was also restive and displeased because Sextus Pompeius,* who now controlled the Mediterranean, had begun to disrupt the grain supply to Rome.
6)	Antony’s wife, Fulvia and his brother Lucius Antonius, who was consul in 41 BC were the ring leaders of a city-wide “revolt”. They whipped up discontent and fear among the people by spreading anti-Octavianic  propaganda. It is likely that they were trying to draw attention to the fact that Octavian was gaining the support of Antony’s solders, with land grants to get them over to his side. They raised “several” legions. Their activitirs prompted Octavian to maneuver them out of Rome. They fled to Perugia, where Octavian put them under siege and forced their submission. Octavian let Fulvia and Lucius Antonius go free, but he barred them from Rome. Fulvia was sent out to Greece to return to her husband, Antony, but she died en route. Lucius Antonius was sent to Spain as governor, to get him out of Rome. Perugia was punished for having harbored the “criminals” and their supporters.
7)	What were Fulvia's motives? 
i.	Augustus revised the narrative and blamed her boldness (audacia) on her jealousy of Cleopatra, and her desire to get Antony back in Rome. 
ii.	Antony had met Cleopatra in the summer of 41 BC, and they were lovers by this time (Plut. Ant 23-30; App. BC 5. 4-11; Dio 48.24-25). However, Fulvia could not have known about them; news didn’t travel fast. 
iii.	In any case, with Fulvia dead, Antony eventually agreed with Octavian to push this false narrative.
8)	Insults and invective 
i.	The Roman poet Martial preserves an epigram* or short satirical poem (11. 20) which he claims was written by Octavian; it insinuates that the war was caused by Fulvia’s jealousy of Antony’s adulterous behavior. 
ii.	Sling bullets unearthed at the battle site near Perusia, were launched by both sides (Lucius Antonius’ soldiers and Octavian’s soldiers); they are known as the Perusine Sling Bullets. 
iii.	The Perusine Sling Bullets were inscribed with graffiti, which promoted vicious propaganda against Lucius Antonius, Fulvia and Octavian in most vulgar terms: The inscriptions attacked Lucius’ baldness, Octavian’s effeminacy, and Fulvia’s sexual promiscuity, all the standard insults and tropes we would expect to find in invective (a form or genre of insulting rhetoric with vulgar and extremely abusive language).
9)	What was Fulvia’s real role in the Perusine conflict? 
i.	The source report many instances of Fulvia protecting Antony, whose position was compromised because he was away. Fulvia was in Rome, and as Antony’s wife she was most likely just looking after his interests in his absence. As Octavian’s mother-in-law (he was married to Antony’s step-daughter, Clodia) Fulvia has some relevance. Antony may have been counting on Fulvia to protect his interests. But both men took advantage of Fulvia’s death, and blamed the episode on her jealousy, when they decided to re-establish peace. When Octavian started bringing Antonius’ soldiers over to his side, Fulvia even brought their children before them to beg them not to forget the name of their former victorious general (App. 5. 2.14). In addition, the sources defame Fulvia for her boldness (which they exaggerate) because she was a woman, a typical trope (metaphor). She (allegedly) personally conducted negotiations with Octavian’s soldiers “strapping on a sword, giving orders and arguing with the men.” (App. B. Civ. 5. 3.19; Dio 48.10.3). However, Lucius Antonius probably had political partisans who may have wanted to overthrow Octavian. In addition, Antony’s response to the event and his behavior, as we will see, is puzzling, and hard to read.
10)	The Aftermath of the Perusine War 
i.	Octavian continued to be the object of increasing hatred because of his proscriptions and confiscations. 
ii.	When the governor of Transalpine Gaul died, his son left the vacant province to Octavian. 
iii.	The Gallic provinces had been designated for Anthony according the original Triumviral agreement. 
iv.	The bequest of Transalpine Gaul to Octavian (at his behest) gave him an opportunity to challenge Antony’s authority; it was a breach of faith. 
v.	With greater power, Octavian continued to confront Antony, whose plans at this juncture are unclear: the sources refer to secret negotiations with Sextus Pompeius, with the intention of invading Italy, evidently headed off by negotiations and the framing of the Peace of Brundisium, resetting the terms of the alliance.
11)	The Siege of Brundisium 40 BC 
i.	In 40 BC Antony and Octavian come to blows in Brundisium over the Perusine war and the issue of common recruiting ground for Triumvirs: 
1.	By a previous agreement the Triumvirs were allowed to use Italy as a common recruiting ground. * 
ii.	But in 40 BC when Antony, who may have first intrigued with Sextus, got to Brundisium, - whether to simply recruit troops, or to invade Italy, he found that Octavian had closed the city to him. 
iii.	Angered at having been refused admission, Antony laid siege to the town, and he allowed his troops to loot other towns in southern Italy, until Octavian's forces got there. 
iv.	*Although Octavian’s re-establishment of Cisalpine Gaul as a district of Italy suggests that he intended to use recruit armies there only for himself.
12)	Peace of Brundisium 40 BC
i.	Another civil war seemed imminent because many of Antony’s troops had gone over to Octavina’s side
ii.	However, Antony backed off; aided by the diplpmacy of Maecenas Octavina’s supporter, Antony’s officer, Asinius Pollio, and finally Antony’s mother, Julia, there were negotiations and a truce was reached
13)	In 40 BC a new agreement, known as the peace of Brundisum was forged. 
i.	The terms; 1. Renewal of Triumvirate, ii, Africa restored to Lepidus iii. Italy was to be common recruiting ground iv. All gallic provinces were to go to Octavian v. The East was to go to Antony. The power grab was now defined by east and west 
14)	40 BC Marriage of Octavia and Antony: The Peace of Brundisium was sealed by the marriage of Antony, now a widower,* to Octavian’s sister, Octavia, also recently widowed.** Rome may have had hopes for a period of peace, but these were short-lived.
15)	Florus Epitome XVI: The War Round Perusia 
i.	The distribution of lands to the soldiers was the cause of another war. 
ii.	For Caesar*assigned land to his father's veterans as a reward for their services. Although the nature of (Marcus) Antonius was always evil, on this occasion his wife Fulvia girding herself with the sword of her husband's service, egged on his brother Lucius, yet more. Consequently, Lucius Antonius stirred up further hostilities by rousing the farmers, who had been dispossessed of their lands. 
iii.	Lucius Antonius was thereupon declared a public enemy, not merely in the judgment of private citizens, but by the votes of the whole senate, and Caesar, attacking him, drove him within the walls of Perusia and by the humiliating device of starvation, against which he tried every expedient, finally reduced him to surrender.
16)	Timeline of the aftermath of the Perusine War 
i.	Early in 40 BC after Perugia falls to Octavian, Asinius Pollio, Antony‘s general makes plans for his (Antony’s) return to Italy to recruit troops for his eastern command and helps him smooth things over with Octavian. 
ii.	When Antony learns the outcome of the Perusine War, and that Octavian has taken Transalpine Gaul for himself, he secretly meets with Sextus Pompeius and lays plans to invade Italy, arriving at Brundisium, only to find himself barred by Octavian. 
iii.	However, another war is avoided, and a peace is formulated, sealed by the marriage of Octavia (Octavian’s recently widowed sister) to Antony, also, (as we have seen) recently widowed; in addition, the provinces were redistributed.
f.	Sextus Pimpeius, Marriage to Livia, Disgrace of Lepidus
1)	39 BC Threats of Sextus Pompeius: The Peace of Misenum Insulted at not having been included in the Peace of Brundisium, Sextus Pompeius threatened to starve Rome into submission by withholding the grain shipments from Sicily. A famine in Rome and supplyline disruptions led Antony and Octavian to offer an agreement with Sextus Pompeius at Misenum, which he eventually accepted in 39 BC: The agreement is known as the Peace of Misenum.
2)	The terms of the Peace of Misenum (39 BC) are as follows: Sextus Pompeius was to remove his garrisons from Italy, to allow grain shipments to get to Rome. In return, he was allowed to control Sicily and Sardinia, Corsica and the Peloponnesos. With the exception of anybody implicated in the death of Caesar, all those proscribed and exiled by the Triumvirate were allowed to return to Rome. All properties were to be restored to the exiles; one quarter of their properties was to be restored to the proscribed. Sextus was designated as consul for 33 BC; he was also promised an augurate and allowed to inherit from his father’s estate.
3)	Between 39 and 37 BC Antony was in the east campaigning against the Parthians and he succeeded in routing them out of Syria, Armenia and Cappadocia, restoring some control to Rome in the east (Asinius Pollio, king Herod, Ventidius Bassus fought under Antony). However, by 39 BC Octavian and Antony started to drift apart again. Antony was now supported by the optimates, the senate, the moderates and the equestrians; Octavian was supported by the masses, the soldiers and his veterans. The Peace of Misenum had made Italy safer for optimates and the proscribed, since it gave Sextus Pompeius, an optimaris, legitimacy and political recognition; consequently, there were more optimates back in Rome. And at this point, Octavian began to court the aristocracy to improve his political image and connections, and to lend prestige to his regime.
4)	In 38 BC Octavian married Livia Drusilla. Octavian divorced his second wife, Scribonia on the very day she gave birth to their daughter Julia (!), and married Livia. They would be happily married for the rest of their long lives. Scribonia was the aunt of Sextus Pompeius’ first wife, (also named) Scribonia (i.e., the aunt of Sextus by marriage). The marriage of Octavian to Livia was intended to seal the Peace of Misenum negotiated with Sextus.
5)	Livia (Drusilla) was from the patrician Claudian family. By marrying Livia, Octavian forged many new socio-political alliances and patronage opportunities; the connection to the Claudians also improved his pedigree and image with the upper classes. Livia’s first husband Tiberius Claudius Nero, was happy to divorce her in return for Octavian’s political restoration;*as a Republican, Tiberius Claudius Nero had been proscribed for his role in the Perusine War. The irony of Livia’s marriage to the very man who had proscribed her first husband was not lost on Octavian’s detractors (!) In the wake of the Perusine War, Livia, her husband and their young son Tiberius had been forced to flee Rome for Greece (Sparta), a safehaven for optimates.
6)	It is not known where and when Livia and Octavian met, though it is (ironically) possible that she might have been introduced to him through her aunt by adoption, Octavian’s then-but-soon-to-be-ex-wife, Scribonia: Dio (48.34.3) reports the beginning of the affair: in 39 BC Octavian organised a party to celebrate shaving off his beard possibly on his birthday, September 23rd. “For example, when Caesar now for the first time shaved off his beard, he held a magnificent entertainment himself, besides granting all the other citizens a festival at public expense. He also kept his chin smooth afterwards, like the rest.” Octavian wanted to look his best because he ‘‘was already beginning to love Livia.” The coldblooded Octavian, who had proscribed Livia’s husband, driven her into exile, and whose previous marriages had been political and loveless, had now fallen madly in love with Livia, though the marriage also was a strategic political alliance for them both.
7)	The union was mutually beneficial: 
i.	For Livia, Octavian was a good catch: the sources report she quickly recognised his interest in her, and turned it to her advantage 
ii.	Livia harboured ambitions for her sons, and sought alliance with the most powerful man in Roman
iii.	Tacitus suggests Livia may have actively encouraged Octavian’s attentions, when he reports that Octavian took her away from her husband incertum an invitam
iv.	Her first husband had not had a distinguished career in politics, and Livia had ambitions for her sons, Tiberius and Drusus, who would become Octavian’s stepsons * 
v.	She was pregnant with Drusus when she was betrothed (engaged) to Octavian; marriage to the most powerful man in the west began the process of their promotion.
8)	The Wives of Octavian Octavian was married three times. His third marriage to Livia was for love and for life. He was only 24 and she was only 20 (!) His first wife was the daughter of Fulvia by her first marriage to Clodius Pulcher. Since she was Antony’s stepdaughter, the marriage to Clodia was thus a political marriage of alliance. The intrusion by Fulvia and Antony’s brother, Lucius Antonius in the political affairs of Octavian in the socalled Perusine War led Octavian to divorce Clodia on grounds that the marriage had never been consummated. Octavian’s second marriage was also a political alliance: Scribonia was the aunt (by marriage) of Sextus Pompeius, the surviving son of Pompey the Great. The marriage sealed the short-lived détente between the Second Triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius, mandated by the Peace of Misenum
9)	Suetonius, Life of Augustus 62.1-2; 63.1 1. “In his youth he was betrothed to the daughter of Publius Servilius Isauricus, but when he became reconciled with Antony after their first quarrel, and their troops begged that the rivals be further united by some tie of kinship, he took as his wife Antony's stepdaughter Clodia, daughter of Fulvia by Publius Clodius, although she was barely of marriageable age; but because of a falling out with his motherin-law Fulvia, he divorced her before they had begun to live together. 2. Shortly after that he married Scribonia, who had been wedded before, to two ex-consuls, and was a mother by one of them. He divorced her also, “unable to put up with her shrewish disposition,” as he himself writes, and at once took Livia Drusilla from her husband Tiberius Nero, although she was pregnant at the time; and he loved and esteemed her to the end without a rival. 63. 1 By Scribonia he had a daughter Julia, by Livia no children at all, though he earnestly desired them.”
10)	Dio 48. 44 1. “Besides these occurrences at that time, Octavian married Livia. She was the daughter of Livius Drusus, who had been among those proscribed and committed suicide after the defeat in Macedonia (Philippi), and the wife of C.T. Nero, whom she had accompanied in his flight, as has been related. And she was in the sixth month with child by him. 2. At any rate, when Octavian was in doubt and enquired of the pontifices whether it was allowed to wed her while pregnant, they answered that if there was any doubt whether conception had taken place the marriage should be put off, but if this was admitted, there was nothing to prevent it from taking place immediately. Perhaps they really found this in the ordinances of the forefathers but certainly they would have said so, even had they not found it (i.e., they were not going to say no to Octavian). 3. Her husband (T. C. Nero) himself gave the woman in marriage just as a father would; and the following incident occurred at the marriage feast. One of the prattling boys, such as the women keep about them for their amusement, naked as a rule, on seeing Livia reclining in one place with Octavian, and her ex-husband in another with a man, went up to her and said: “What are you doing here, mistress? For your husband,” pointing him out, “is reclining over there.” 4. So much then, for this. Later, when the woman was now living with Octavian, she gave birth to Drusus. Octavian both acknowledged him and sent him to his real father, making his entry in his memoranda: “Octavian returned to its father Drusus the child borne by Livia, his wife.” 5. T. C. Nero died not long afterward and left Octavian himself as guardian to the boy and to Tiberius. Now the populace gossiped a great deal about this and said, among other things, “The lucky have children in three months;” and this saying passed into a proverb.”
11)	Bellum Siculum: War in Sicily against Sextus Pompeius 38-36 BC The defeat of Sextus Pompeius by the Triumvirate ended any hope for the restoration of the constitutional government of the republic. It also led to the end of the Triumvirate itself since Octavian was able to take advantage of Lepidus’ weakness (inability to command his armies) and questionable loyalty, to remove him from the Triumvirate, although he spared his life. This left Octavian and Antony as the only rulers of the Mediterranean, and it set the stage for a civil war between the two men. In 38 BC Octavian tried to invade Sicily and expel Sextus but was forced to retreat his fleet because of bad weather. This defeat and failure led Octavian to commission Agrippa to dig a proper harbor, build a new fleet of larger war ships and recruit and train a larger naval force (now with newly enfranchised slaves or freedmen), for naval battles. See below Appendix: Agrippa and the Navy: The Harbor works at Misenum
12)	More problems with Sextus Pompeius
i.	By 38 Sextus Pompeius had consolidated his authority in Sicily and had allowed a usurper to take over Sardinia; this (rogue) general was opposed by another general of Sextus, who began to attack Octavian’s fleets in the straits of Messana; the rest of his fleet was destroyed in a storm. Without Antony’s support, Octavian was unable to subdue Sextus, and he was failing to maintain any authority over Sextus in Sicily (Sextus governed at the pleasure of the Triumvirate, as a client of Rome). At the end of the year Octavian asked Vipsanius Agrippa for help; he began laying plans for a campaign against Sextus and he amassed a huge fleet and navy at Misenum
13)	Treaty of Tarentum 37 BC In 37 BC Antony returned to Italy hoping to borrow soldiers from Octavian in exchange for ships and arms, and once again Octavian snubbed him. Had it not been for Octavian’s sister and Antony’s wife, Octavia’s diplomacy, there could have been a war at this point. But at Octavia’s urging, a conference was held at Tarentum and a treaty was framed in 37 BC. i. An arms exchange was arranged. ii. The Triumvirate was renewed until the end of 33 BC, another five years.
14)	Battle of Naulochus 36 BC 
i.	At the conference of Tarentum it was also agreed that Sicily had to be invaded and Sextus definitively dealt with 
ii.	Antony contributed ships
iii.	Octavian, Agrippa and Lepidus campaigned 
15)	On July 1st 36 BC the fleets of Octavian and Agrippa sailed from Italy, and a third fleet, provided by Lepidus, sailed from Africa, to attack Sextus Pompeius’ stronghold in Sicily. In August, Agrippa defeated Sextus in a naval battle near Mylae, and he was able to shut down most of Sextus’ ports on the northern coast. After difficulty (caused by Sextus’ fleet) crossing the straits to Sicily, Octavian was defeated and wounded in battle near Tauromenium, (southeast coast) and he had to retreat to Leucopetra, in Italy. Octavian returned and finally united his forces with Lepidus, both at the ready to attack Messana; but Sextus launched a surprise attack at Naulochus on September 3rd. Sextus was defeated by the combined fleets of Agrippa and Octavian, and subsequently fled to the east, where he was executed by agents of Antony.
16)	Exit Lepidus Lepidus had sailed from Africa to carry out his part in the war against Sextus (Appian BC 5. 97-98; Dio 49. 1). Octavian and Lepidus were originally to attack Messana, but after Sextus was defeated at Naulochus and had fled, Lepidus made a bid for Sicily. Lepidus seized parts of Sicily and without Octavian’s permission, over Agrippa’s objections, accepted the surrender of Messana, and even took on some of Sextus’ troops. Lepidus’ own soldiers mutinied and deserted him; Octavian defeated him, stripped him of his command, and expelled him from the Triumvirate, (without consulting Antony); however, Octavian also spared his life and allowed him to keep his priesthood (Pontifex Maximus) until his death.
17)	Octavian committed Lepidus to honorary confinement at Circeii, (San Felice Circeo) a coastal town in southern Latium. When Lepidus died in 12 BC, Octavian, now Augustus, assumed the office of Pontifex Maximus for life, as did all emperors thereafter until the end of the 4th c AD
18)	The Matter of Lepidus’ actions in Sicily raises questions: Usurpation does not seem characteristic of Lepidus; was he ambitious? power hungry, competitive? Did Octavian trump up charges that Lepidus had illegally staked claim to Sicily, after Sextus was out of the way, to narrow down the competition to Antony? And (later) as Augustus, did he revise the narrative tradition, perpetuated in the sources? In sum, did Octavian orchestrate Lepidus’ removal because he was easy to get rid of?
19)	Periochae Rise and Fall of Sextus Pompeius [
i.	127. 5] [39 BC] Because an enemy close to Italy, Sextus Pompeius, occupied Sicily and threatened the grain trade, Caesar and Antony concluded, at his demand, a peace treaty with him, so that he could rule Sicily as a province. 
ii.	[128. 1] [38 BC] When Sextus Pompeius through piracy made the sea dangerous again and did not maintain the peace he had agreed upon, Caesar accepted the necessary war against him, and fought two naval battles, with a dubious outcome. 
iii.	[129. 1] [36 BC] Naval battles with varying outcomes were fought against Sextus Pompeius, in the following way: of the two navies of Caesar, the one, whose admiral was Agrippa, was victorious, but the other, commanded by Caesar, was destroyed and the soldiers that had been set ashore were exposed to grave danger. 
iv.	[129. 2] The defeated Pompeius fled to [the interior of] Sicily. 
v.	[129. 3] When Marcus Lepidus, who had arrived from Africa as if to support Caesar in his struggle against Sextus Pompeius, launched a war against Caesar, he was abandoned by his army, deprived of his triumviral powers, but successfully begged for his life. 
vi.	[129. 4] Marcus Agrippa received a naval crown from Caesar, an honor that no one had received before. 
vii.	[131. 1] [35] Although Sextus Pompeius had put himself under the protection of Mark Antony, he prepared for war against him in Asia, but was surprised and executed by his deputies.
20)	Vipsanius Agrippa 
i.	The war against Sextus was not won by any heroism of Octavian, who typically, did not shower himself in glory; Agrippa saved the effort and brought home the victory. 
ii.	Suetonius 16 2. reports that Octavian’s lack of military skill, was the object of Antony’s ridicule: 
iii.	“And it was this, I think, that gave Antony opportunity for the taunt: “He could not even look with steady eyes at the fleet when it was ready for battle, but lay in a stupor on his back, looking up at the sky, and did not rise or appear before the soldiers until the enemy's ships had been put to flight by Marcus Agrippa.” 
iv.	Velleius Paterculus 2. 79 
v.	“But fortune’s caprice at this critical period was soon amended by bravery in action; when the fleets on both sides had been drawn up for battle, (Sextus) Pompey lost almost all his ships, and fled to Asia, where, wavering between the role of general and suppliant, now endeavoring to retain his dignity and now pleading for his life, he was slain by Titius (Statilius Taurus) on orders of Marcus Antonius, whose aid he had sought.”

22)	Agrippa and Neptune: commemorating defeat of Sextus in the Battle of Nauochus
23)	For his role in the Battle of Naulochus, Agrippa was awarded the corona navalis, the naval crown, a gold crown surmounted with small replicas of the prows (bows) of ships.
24)	Florus Epitome of History XVIII. The War against Sextus Pompeius 39-36 BC: 
i.	“Though Caesar's* assassins had been thus removed Pompey’s family still survived. One of his young sons had fallen in Spain, but the other had escaped by flight, and after collecting the survivors of their unsuccessful war, and also arming the slave-prisons, was holding Sicily and Sardinia. He had also occupied the central (Mediterranean) sea with his fleet. 
ii.	But how great the difference between Sextus and his father! The latter had exterminated the Cilician pirates, his son protected himself by piracy. He ravaged Puteoli, Formiae, Vulturnum, in a word, the whole coast of Campania, the Pontine marshes, Aenaria and even the mouth of the river Tiber. Then, meeting with Caesar's fleet, he burnt and sank it and not only Pompeius himself, but also Menas and Menecrates, base slaves whom he had put in command of his fleet, made sudden raids in search of plunder along all the coasts. 
iii.	In return for all these successes he made a sacrifice of a hundred bulls with gilded horns at Pelorum and flung a living horse with an offering of gold into the straits as gifts to Neptune to induce the ruler of the sea to allow him to reign in his domain. At last, the danger became so great that a treaty of peace was concluded with the enemy if a son of Pompey can be called an enemy. 
iv.	How great was the joy (though it was short-lived), when an agreement** was made on the embankment on the shores of Baiae, permitting his return and the restitution of his property, and when, at his invitation, they dined on board his ship, and railing against his fate, he said, “There are keels (carinae) where I live,” a witty remark, seeing that his father had lived in Carinae, the most fashionable quarter of the capital, while his own home and household gods tossed in a ship.”
v.	“But owing to the incivility of Antonius and because the spoil from Sextus’ property, of which Antonius had been the purchaser, had been squandered, the entry of Sextus into possession of his estates could not be sustained; thus Sextus began to back out of the pact of agreement.* So recourse was had to arms again, and a fleet was now equipped with all the resources of the empire against the young leader. Preparations for it were made on a magnificent scale. 
vi.	For by cutting through the track of the Herculean Way and digging up the shore, the Lucrine Lake was turned into a harbor and the Lake of Avernus added to it by cutting away the ground between, in order that maneuvering on these quiet waters the fleet might practise a semblance of naval warfare (Agrippa’s work). 
vii.	The young commander (Sextus) was brought to action by this (Agrippa’s) superior force and defeated in the Sicilian straits,** and would have carried with him to the grave the reputation of a great leader if he had attempted nothing further; but it is a characteristic of genius never to lose hope. 
viii.	When his position became desperate, he fled away and made sail for Asia, only to fall there into the hands of the enemy (Antonius) and to suffer imprisonment and undergo the most wretched fate which can befall a brave man, namely, death by the sword of the executioner at the bidding of his foes. 
ix.	There had been no such pitiable flight since that of Xerxes; for he, who had been but lately lord of three hundred and fifty ships, fled with six or seven, and with the lights extinguished on his flagship, after throwing his rings into the sea, casting anxious looks behind him, though his only fear was lest he should fail to meet with death.”
25)	Appendix: Agrippa and the Navy: The Harbor works at Misenum Known for his naval skills and victories, Agrippa created the first naval fleet and built the Portus Julius at Cumae, the first harbor and a base for the western Roman fleet, the classis Misenensis (Dio 48, 49). Located on a peninsula on the north shore of the Bay of Naples, Misenum provided an ideal location in which Agrippa could build and train a fleet to counter Sextus Pompeius, who was a threat because he controlled the shipping lanes for the grain supply; Agrippa chose a strategic location and water source to accommodate the fleet, inland and out of site of the enemy, at Lake Averno, because it was invisible from the surrounding sea (Tyrrhenian) and the Bay of Naples. The plan worked: the construction of the new fleet remained unknown to Sextus’ fleet, which patrolled the Bay of Naples for enemy ships. After the fleet was complete and the navy was trained, Agrippa defeated Sextus in the Battle of Naulochus (off the north coast of Sicily), the decisive naval battle of the campaign.
26)	Agrippa was mandated by Octavian to create the first naval fleet and harbor, the Portus Julius at Cumae. 
27)	In 37 BC Agrippa dug a canal to connect Lake Averno to Lake Lucrino and a second, shorter canal with a hidden entrance between Lake Lucrino and the sea (see next side). A long road and access tunnel, the Grotta di Cocceio, was also dug from Lake Averno north to the town of Cumae.
28)	Port of Misenum Shortly after the victory at Naulochus, the first Portus Julius was abandoned, because of the accumulation of silt that made it unnavigable. With the elimination of Sextus, secrecy was no longer necessary, and consequently a second and larger naval base was constructed at Misenum, a port town which was now fed by the Aqua Augusta, an aqueduct which also supplied Cumae, Naples, Pompeii and other towns in the Bay of Naples. The outer harbor behind Cape Misenum served the fleet and provided room for training exercises, while the inner harbor (connected by a canal) was designed for the reserve fleet, repairs, and as a refuge from storms. Because of its location, this site controlled the entire Italian west coast, the islands and the Straits of Messina.

g.	Antony and Cleopatra; Statue Grant 
1)	Antony in the East with Cleopatra 41-33 BC After the meeting at Tarentum, at which the Peace of Tarentum was made in 37 BC, Antony returned to the east to resume his Parthian campaigns. The treaty, according to the sources, negotiated with the help of Octavia, Antony’s devoted wife, led to an arms exchange, and the renewal of the Triumvirate until the end of 33 BC. As a matter of establishing context for Antony and Cleopatra, note that in the eastern Mediterranean, the territorial divisions and administrative organization undertaken by Pompey (the Great) in the late sixties BC for Asia, Bithynia and Syria, had largely been left intact. In addition, one of the vassal kingdoms of Rome was Egypt, an important asset, which had been commended to the Roman people by the Ptolemies in 65 BC.
2)	Early in 41 BC Antony went to Egypt, officially on behalf of the Second Triumvirate to discipline Cleopatra for having given aid to Cassius and Brutus, the Tyrannicides, in the Battle of Philippi. The real reason was to extort monies from the treasuries of the Ptolemies for his Parthian campaigns. Soon after his visit, just when Perugia fell, and Fulvia was near death, Cleopatra conceived their first two children, twins, Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene. After a second meeting with Antony in 36 BC Cleopatra became his wife, married him and had a third child with him, Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra had had Caesarion with Caesar in 44BC).
3)	In 36 Antony met Cleopatra in Syria, publicly proclaimed the paternity of his children with her, and gave her Syria, Cyprus and Cilicia. By marrying Cleopatra, Antony also inherited joint rule of several other strong eastern kingdoms, previously ruled solely by Cleopatra.
4)	Plutarch 36. 1-3 36 BC 
i.	“But the dire evil which had been slumbering for a long time, namely, Antony’s passion for Cleopatra, which men thought had been charmed away and lulled to rest by better considerations, blazed up again with renewed power as he drew near to Syria. And finally, like the stubborn and unmanageable beast of the soul, of which Plato speaks , he spurned away all saving and noble counsels and sent Fonteius Capito to bring Cleopatra to Syria. 
ii.	And when she was come, he made her a present of no slight or insignificant addition to her dominions, namely, Phoenicia, Syria, Cyprus, and a large part of Cilicia; and still further, the balsam-producing part of Judaea, and all that part of Arabia Nabataea which slopes toward the outer sea. These gifts particularly annoyed the Romans. 
iii.	The shamefulness of these honors conferred upon Cleopatra gave most offence. And he heightened the scandal by acknowledging his two children by her, and called one Alexander and the other Cleopatra, with the surname for the first of Sun, and for the other of Moon.”
5)	35 BC Octavian versus Antony: final confrontation Consequently, in the mid-thirties Octavian launched a smear campaign against Antony. He portrayed Antony as the weak over-sexed, alcoholic slave of an evil eastern queen, who would someday take over Rome. Octavian also manipulated popular fears of the east and took advantage of the fact that Antony was not in Rome to defend himself.
6)	Octavian also attacked Antony more directly, portraying him as an emasculated (sex) slave of Cleopatra
7)	Antony linked himself to Hercules in his public images 
8)	Octavian used the connection to Hercules and perverted it to defame his rival, invoking the myth of Hercules and Omphale 
9)	Ring: Hercules with the features of M. Antonius 
10)	Octavian used the Myth of Hercules and Omphale: 
i.	Eurytus promised the hand of his daught Iole to the man who could defeat him and his sons in an archery contest 
ii.	Hercules won the archery contest but Eurytus repudiated his promise, because he suspected Hercules of having stolen his mares 
iii.	However Iphitus, Eurytus’ son was convinced of Hercules’ innocence, and offered to help him 
iv.	Yet typically, in a fit of anger Hercules threw Iphitus to his death 
11)	As penance for his crime, Hercules was forced to serve the Lydian queen Omphale as her slave for several years. Compensation was also to be paid to Eurytus, who refused it. It was shameful for Hercules to serve an eastern woman in this fashion, and she shamed him: she took his lion’s skin as well as his weapons, forced him to wear female clothes and to do female, menial labor. 
12)	Later Hellenistic and Roman sources make fun of Hercules having been forced to do women’s work. Not only did he have to wear women’s clothing, but he also had to hold a basket of wool while Omphale and her maidens did their spinning 
13)	Ovid: Omphale wore the skin of the Nemean Lion and carried Hercules’ club 
14)	35 BC Statue Grant (Dio 49. 38. 1) To highlight the moral shortcomings of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian also gave the Statue Grant to Octavia and Livia; by the Statue Grant, the sister and wife of Octavian were awarded: i. The right to erect statues of themselves in the Roman forum. ii. The jus trium (privileges and honors that came with producing three children, including freedom from guardianship). iii. The tribunician sacrosanctity. These honors were aimed mainly at Octavia to publicly denounce Antony and to highlight her as a model of moral propriety, and insinuate the moral impropriety of Antony and Cleopatra. In addition, because she had the sacrosanctity of a tribune of the plebs, i.e., her body and mind were inviolable, anyone who harmed Octavia was theoretically (and potentially by law) subject to pain of death, as if she were a tribune of the plebs. Thus, Antony’s abuse of Octavia was grounds for prosecution for a crime and declaration of war: it was a casus belli (a cause or reason for war).
15)	The Marbury type portrait of Livia (left) is veristic (realistically individuated and unflattering), it is believed to have been commissioned to highlight Livia’s western virtue, in opposition to Cleopatra’s eastern corruption; the Fayoum portrait of Livia is more idealized, and ‘beautiful.’ The Marbury type may have been produced as a result of the Statue Grant, to erect in the Forum.
16)	35 BC Statue Grant Dio 49. 38. 1: “After this, Octavian left Fufius Geminus there with a small force and himself returned to Rome. The triumph which had been voted to him he deferred, but he granted to Octavia and Livia statues, the right of their own affairs without a guardian, and the same security and inviolability as the tribunes enjoyed.”
17)	A. Barret (Livia) on the Statue Grant: mainly aimed at Octavia Livia’s honors were more of a response to the “relentless indignities heaped upon Octavia by her husband, rather than as a measure designed to enhance Livia’s status.” “Plutarch (54.1) reveals the workings of Octavian’s mind at this point: he was preparing for a war with Antony. When Octavia asked permission from Octavian to join Antony in 35 BC, he granted it, to give him a reasonable pretext for war, if Antony continued to abuse her.” “Antony could be guaranteed to perform on cue, and when Octavia was sent back from Athens to Rome that year, her public humiliation was palpable.” “Octavian could now denounce Antony in the Senate and before the people, contrasting his sister’s noble conduct with Antony’s unworthy behavior.” It was Octavia rather than Livia who was central to Octavian’s agenda in 35 BC with the statue grant, and it is significant that Dio puts her name first in his account of the honors.”
18)	To injure the majesty of a tribune was to commit a crime against the people, which was grounds for declaring war. Octavian remembered that in 49 BC, when, as tribunes, Cassius and Antony had been assaulted in the senate, and had fled to Caesar, he invoked this law to justify crossing the Rubicon and going to war with Pompey.
19)	53. 1. Plutarch reveals the political importance of the Statue Grant for Octavian, making Octavia a casus belli: “But at Rome Octavia was desirous of sailing to Antony, and Caesar gave her permission to do so, as the majority say, not as a favor to her, but in order that, in case she were neglected and treated with scorn, he might have plausible grounds for war.” Plutarch (54.1-2) reveals Octavia's humiliation and loyalty to Antony; Octavia speaks frankly to Octavian: 1. As for Octavia, she was thought to have been treated with scorn, and when she came back from Athens, Caesar ordered her to dwell in her own house. But she refused to leave the house of her husband, nay, she even entreated Caesar himself, unless on other grounds he had determined to make war upon Antony, to ignore Antony’s treatment of her, since it was an infamous thing even to have it said that the two greatest imperators in the world plunged the Romans into civil war, the one out of passion for, and the other out of resentment on behalf of, a woman. 2. These were her words, and she confirmed them by her deeds. For she dwelt in her husband’s house, just as if he were at home, and she cared for his children, not only those whom she herself, but also, those whom Fulvia had borne him, in a noble and magnificent manner; she also received such friends of Antony as were sent to Rome in quest of office or on business and helped them to obtain from Caesar what they wanted. Without meaning it, however, she was damaging Antony by this conduct of hers; for he was hated for wronging such a woman.”
20)	The Donations of Alexandria 34 BC In 34 BC Antony publicly announced the territories he planned to give to Cleopatra and their children: 
i.	Antony gave away many territories of the Roman East to Cleopatra and her children. These are known as the Donations of Alexandria 
ii.	He also declared Caesarion to be Julius Caesar’s legal heir. 
iii.	Rumors were also spread of the donations by Cleopatra of her eastern territories and kingdoms to their children.
21)	Plutarch 54. 3-6: “Donations” of Alexandria 34 BC 3. “Antony was hated, too, for the distribution which he had made to his children in Alexandria; it was seen as theatrical and arrogant, and to evince hatred of Rome. For after filling the gymnasium with a throng and placing on a tribunal of silver two thrones of gold, one for himself and the other for Cleopatra, and other lower thrones for his sons: 4. In the first place he declared Cleopatra Queen of Egypt, Cyprus, Libya, and Syria, and she was to share her throne with Caesarion. Caesarion was believed to be a son of the former Caesar, by whom Cleopatra was left pregnant. In the second place, he proclaimed his own sons by Cleopatra Kings of Kings, and to Alexander he allotted Armenia, Media and Parthia (when he should have subdued it), to Ptolemy , he allotted Phoenicia, Syria, and Cilicia. 5. At the same time, he also produced his sons, Alexander arrayed in Median garb, including a tiara and upright head-dress, Ptolemy in boots, a short cloak, and abroad-brimmed hat surmounted by a diadem; for the latter was the dress of the kings who followed Alexander, the former that of Medes and Armenians. 6. And when the boys had embraced their parents, one was given a bodyguard of Armenians, the other of Macedonians. Cleopatra, indeed, both then and at other times when she appeared in public, assumed a robe sacred to Isis, and was addressed as the New Isis.”
22)	32 BC Divorce Papers and Expulsion of Octavia from Antony' s house in Rome (!) Octavia presented herself as Antony’s wife until 32 BC when Antony formally divorced her. Antony sent the divorce papers to Octavia in Rome, and then he sent representatives to Rome (from Athens) to throw her out of his house. Yet the long suffering and humiliated Octavia continued to care for their children, including the children of Fulvia and Antony, and she now lived in secluded retirement. Periochae [132.2] [33 BC] Marc Antony, because of his love for Cleopatra, with whom he had two sons ( Philadelphus and Alexander), did neither want to come to the city, nor lay down his powers when the terms of the triumvirate had ended, prepared for war against the city and Italy, and gathered for this purpose as many naval as land forces. [32 BC] and sent a letter of divorce to Octavia, Caesar's (Octavian's) sister
23)	Plutarch (57. 1-3) writes about Antony and Cleopatra’s reception in Athens, while Octavia was turned out of Antony’s house in Rome. 1. “When these festivities were over, Antony gave the dramatic artists Priene as a place for them to dwell, and sailed himself to Athens, where sports and theatres again engaged him. Cleopatra, too, jealous of Octavia's honors in the city (for Octavia was especially beloved by the Athenians), tried by many splendid gifts to win the favor of the people. 2. So the people voted honors to her, and sent a deputation to her house carrying the vote, of whom Antony was one, for was he not a citizen of Athens? And standing in her presence he delivered a speech on behalf of the city. To Rome, however, he sent men who had orders to eject Octavia from his house. 3. And we are told that she left it taking all his children with her except his eldest son by Fulvia, who was with his father; she was in tears of distress that she herself also would be regarded as one of the causes of the war. But the Romans felt pity for Antony, not for her,* and especially those who had seen Cleopatra and knew that neither in youthfulness nor beauty was she superior to Octavia.” *Pity because Octavia was so superior to Cleopatra, however they were outraged by Antony’s shabby treatment of her.
24)	The Public Shaming of Octavia by Antony (!) “final straw.” Octavian responded by (illegally) taking Antony's will from the custody of the Vestal Virgins and reading it out to the senate and the people of Rome. Octavian alleged that the will made provision for generous territorial donations to their children (confirming Antony's Alexandrian Donations of 34 BC). The will also (allegedly) stipulated that Antony be buried in Alexandria next to Cleopatra. These actions were very unpopular in Rome, and the Senate, “of its own accord,”* swore an extraordinary oath of loyalty to Octavian. The sources report the Senate and people of Rome were shocked and outraged, although over a third of the senate had fled Rome by now.
25)	In sum, the will-whether it was genuine or forged- “confirmed” the Donations of Alexandria, i.e. the legacies of the children of Antony and Cleopatra. Finally, it “declared” that Cleopatra and Caesar’s son Caesarion was their true son, and Caesar’s dynastic heir.* Octavian was now able to publicly denounce the abuses that Antony had committed to the honor of Octavia, a woman with the sacrosanctity of the tribune. Octavian had provoked popular revulsion and disgust toward Antony and Cleopatra. He had made Octavia a casus belli (cause of war); armed conflicts had erupted over harming tribunes.
26)	32 BC Declaration of War In 32 BC Octavian formally declared war on Cleopatra. He had full the support of the people and the senate. The senate pronounced Antony an enemy of the state, as well. Octavian stripped Antony of his imperium and his consulship for the next year (31 BC). With propaganda and intimidation Octavian also secured an oath of personal allegiance from Rome, from all Italian towns and the western provinces. In sum, Octavian had made what was a brutal civil war seem like a legitimate foreign war.
h.	Battle of Actium 
1)	Ship of Mark Antony in the naval battle of Actium, September 31 BC. Woodcut engraving, published in 1880.
i.	The battle of Actium is important historically because it marks the end of an era; however, the details of the battle itself are disputed and scholars offer several different interpretations of events.
2)	The Historical Tradition-Historiographic Overview Since the beginning of the 20th century the dominant modern view (established by Johannes Kromayer), has been that Antony, weakened by developments over the summer, and hopelessly outnumbered in ships, entered the Battle of Actium without hope of a victory, and was aiming simply to achieve a breakout to end his investment (state of being surrounded) with a maneuver that would lead to his escape. Following this line of reasoning, the Battle of Actium was believed to have gone largely as he had planned. Alexander Tarn promoted a rival theory that Antony was aiming for a victory but having been ruined by massive defections from his armies and navies, he determined to retreat. Christopher Pelling promoted a model somewhere in between: Antony may have retained some hope of victory, but it was unlikely; he recognized this and resigned himself to a defeat. A recent interpretation by Carsten Lange offers a reconstruction of events that follows the ancient sources more closely: although Antony had had a terrible summer campaign, his position was not that desperate; both Antony and his rival, Octavian were eager to resolve the conflict in a battle before the winter. Octavian had only a modest advantage in ships, which would have been compensated by the greater size of Antony’s vessels. Antony took the prudent precaution of stowing sails on his ships to enable him to flee the theater of war only in the event of defeat; however, he entered the battle aiming for victory, and with a realistic chance of success; Cleopatra fled with the Egyptian squadron, but her flight was not the outcome of an agreed upon plan, as the sources suggest; she fled on her own initiative. Antony’s impulsive decision to follow her sealed his fate. Even after he had abandoned them, Antony’s navies fought on bravely.
3)	Pre-battle Preparations Antony’s forces arrived in western Greece in the autumn of 32 BC, and spent the winter at Actium, based at Patrae; Antony and Cleopatra had concentrated their troops and fleet in Greece to prepare for war and discourage Octavian from invading the east; however, in the spring of 31 he crossed the Adriatic unopposed and advanced to the region of Actium. Both sides began preparations for the battle in April or May of 31 BC (Dio 50; Plut. Ant. 61-87; Vell Pat 2. 84-85); over the summer the two sides spent the following months, facing each other off and engaging in indecisive conflicts. As for assets and resources, the sources give various numbers and are generally inconsistent; however, those sources believed to have been based on Livy (who as a contemporary narrator is considered most accurate) agree that Antony’s fleet was a bit smaller, but that the ships themselves were larger.
4)	That said, Dio reports Antony’s situation was deteriorating (Dio 50.11– 13). Plutarch is incomplete, but his details (Vit. Ant. 62-3) confirm Dio. In addition, detachments of Octavian’s fleet under Agrippa had successfully assaulted Antony’s bases in western Greece: before Octavian’s forces had arrived, Agrippa’s forces had captured Methone, Leucas, Patrae and Corinth (Strabo 8.4.3; Dio 50.11.3; 13.5; Vell. Pat. 2.84.1; Oros. 6.19.6. Orosius also reports that from the outset, Antony’s supplies were low; Antony had taken up his position to the south of the straits of Actium because it controlled access to the Ambracian Gulf; Octavian was thus obliged to station his fleet to the north of the straits at the Gomaros Bay. However, Antony’s position had a poor water supply and was vulnerable to malaria; disease was a factor. Antony may have assumed it would be a good place for the final battle (Dio 50. 12. 8, 15. 3). By contrast, Octavian’s position was on higher ground and had a good water supply, with access to the Louros River and springs at Nicopolis.
5)	In sum, we can infer that both sides had fairly equal naval capacity, with Octavian having 250 ships and Antony about 170 ships plus a squadron of 60 Egyptian ships commanded by Cleopatra; so, Octavian had only a slight advantage. A squadron is a group of war ships considered too small to be designated as a fleet; it’s like an auxiliary fleet. By autumn of 31 BC the fleets and troops of both sides were in Actium and anxious to give battle and resolve the conflict before the winter, when it would be impossible to remain with their troops in the region. Antony and Cleopatra decided their best chance was to engage Octavian in a naval battle; they believed they could out-sail Agrippa and they also doubted the loyalty of their own troops and navy, although as it turned out, the Antonian navies fought long after Cleopatra and Antony fled the theater of war. Antony left their land armies under Publius Canidius Crassus.
6)	Was the flight of Cleopatra planned or spontaneous? In short, when the battle began, Antony’s position had become difficult, however, it was probably not as hopeless as is generally assumed, and Octavian’s position was not great either: he had a slightly larger fleet, but it was not a significant advantage; it is important to note that Antony had a reasonable hope of victory. However, the sources report a debate that took place in Antony’s camp, although what exactly was decided is unclear: the deliberations appear to have focussed on the question of whether Antony should withdraw inland, to Thrace or Macedonia and seek a land battle there, or whether he should resolve the war in a naval battle at Actium (Plutarch (Vit. Ant. 63.3-5; Dio 50.14.4-15.3). Canidius argued that Antony should send Cleopatra away, and seek a land battle, but Cleopatra argued for a sea battle (and won) because, according to Plutarch, she was planning to flee; this detail most likely came from sources in Antony’s camp, hostile to Cleopatra, like Q. Dellius who defected to Octavian after this meeting, and briefed him on Antony’s naval assets and plans, just before the Battle of Actium to save himself. As we have seen (7a), this feckless change of allegiance and betrayal of Antony earned Dellius the nickname desultor bellorum civium
7)	It has been argued that Antony planned to fight near the shore so that Agrippa would hesitate to sail around the ends of his line of ships to break through them, a risky and difficult enterprise in shallow water; it has also been argued that this strategy may indicate that Antony planned to fight to win, as opposed to retreat mid-battle. Plutarch reports that Antony’s right wing was commanded by L. Gelleius Publicola; M. (?) Coelius commanded his left wing; Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius commanded the center. Agrippa commanded Octavian’s left wing and Octavian commanded the right wing; Plutarch implies that the center of the forces of Octavian was commanded by Lucius Arruntius (Vit. Ant. 65.1–2, 66.3); we can assume Agrippa was in charge of strategy, as mentioned by Velleius Paterculus. Antony’s land forces were commanded by Canidius, those of Octavian by Taurus
8)	Plutarch also reports that there was no wind at Actium before noon, and thus there was no fighting before noon (Vit. Ant. 65.4). Antony may have been waiting until this point to advance to ensure that if he was defeated, there would be a sailing wind for flight, although presumably Agrippa and Octavian knew the winds too. The narratives of the actual fighting, suggest Agrippa tried to outflank the right wing of Antony (Plut. Vit. Ant. 66. 3; Dio 50. 31.5–6); Antony’s man Publicola responded, with the result that Agrippa’s center was separated from his flank and thrown into confusion. In antiquity commanders used a linear formation in naval battles, arranging their ships in a line, to match the enemy’s line; this tactic reduced a sea battle to a struggle of one ship against another ship. Since Agrippa’s fleet was larger, he did in fact, have an advantage, because he could presumably, outflank Antony’s fleet without weakening his center too much. But in fact, Plutarch mentions a gap in the center of Agrippa’s fleet (Vit. Ant. 66. 3), stating that that Cleopatra fled through “the middle of the combatants” (Vit. Ant. 66. 3-5); this may mean she used the gap to set sail and escape.
9)	Plutarch Antony 66.3-5 Cleopatra flees and Antony follows her: 3. “And now, as Agrippa was extending the left wing with a view to encircling the enemy, Publicola was forced to advance against him, and so was separated from the center. The center falling into confusion and engaging with Arruntius, although the sea-fight was still undecided and equally favorable to both sides, suddenly the sixty ships of Cleopatra were seen hoisting their sails for flight and making off through the midst of the combatants; for they had been posted in the rear of the large vessels and threw them into confusion as they plunged through. 4. The enemy looked on with amazement, seeing that they took advantage of the wind and made for Peloponnesus. Here, indeed, Antony made it clear to all the world that he was swayed neither by the sentiments of a commander nor of a brave man, nor even by his own, but, as someone in pleasantry said that the soul of the lover dwells in another's body, he was dragged along by the woman as if he had become incorporate with her and must go where she did. 5. For no sooner did Antony see her ship sailing off than he forgot everything else, betrayed and ran away from those who were fighting and dying in his cause, got in a five-oared galley, where Alexas the Syrian and Scellius were his only companions, and hastened after the woman who had already ruined him and would make his ruin still more complete.”
10)	In sum, the sources report that Antony and Cleopatra did not dominate in the battle, Dio (50. 31.4) suggesting that the outflanking of Antony’s fleet by Agrippa made him move forward to engage in battle, not because he wanted to, but because he had no other choice. When Cleopatra fled with her squadron, the battle scene was in chaos, with ships trying to board, trying not to get rammed and protecting their oars: what had begun as a linear and orderly battle evolved into chaos. As Lange concludes, a battle plan intending to create a gap in the middle of the fighting ships is unlikely and argues against the notion held by some scholars, that Antony and Cleopatra controlled the battle, and planned for Cleopatra to flee through the middle of the enemy line, using the prevailing wind. Cleopatra’s withdrawal is presented in the sources as her own impulse; the panic described by Dio (50. 33. 1-2) is backed up by other sources, suggesting that Cleopatra led the flight; and in his account Dio also focuses on Antony’s disbelief when he learned that Cleopatra was fleeing.
11)	In the throes of the battle, Cleopatra decided to flee, and Antony followed her; most scholars reject the notion that she betrayed him and tried to sneak off; however, her flight determined the outcome of the battle. She fled when the battle was yet to be decided; and at this crucial point Antony chose Cleopatra over his men (Plut. Vit. Ant. 66. 4-5). In addition, at first Antony did not believe that she had initiated the flight, but instead blamed her squadron (fleet). In Plutarch’s account the confusion in the middle of Antony’s line of ships was caused by Publicola’s move to the right, reacting to Agrippa’s outflanking; this may be when Cleopatra jumped to the conclusion that the battle was lost, and she panicked. Lange has argued that the sequence of events in the withdrawal of Antony and Cleopatra also supports the claim of the sources that Antony’s fleet continued to put up a stiff resistance long after they fled; i.e., they did not defect (Dio 50.34; Plut. Vit. Ant. 68.1; Vell. Pat. 2.85).
12)	After the battle of Actium, Octavian sent envoys to Canidius Crassus and the army of Antony. Ultimately, the army was abandoned by Canidius and the other officers, and the legions changed sides (to Octavian); Canidius fled to join Antony in Egypt, where accused of deserting his troops, he was executed on orders of Octavian (30 BC) (Plut. Vit. Ant. 68.1–3; Dio 51.1.4; Vell. Pat. 2, 85, 2; 87, 3). The troops of Antony had been ordered into Macedonia by him (Plut. Vit. Ant. 67.5) and remained together for seven days (Vit. Ant. 68.3). Then they were incorporated into the forces of Octavian, and some were disbanded (Dio 51.3.1–2). Any pre-battle planning would have made contingency plans for the flight of the land armies in the event of defeat.
13)	After the battle of Actium, Octavian sent envoys to Canidius Crassus and the army of Antony.

Any pre-battle planning would have made contingency plans for the flight of the land armies in the event of defeat.
14)	The Flight of Cleopatra; Lange: “Cleopatra’s action is therefore best explained by supposing that she panicked and prematurely assumed that the day was lost, so initiating ‘Plan B’ of her own volition. Her action triggered Antonius’ fatal decision to follow suit.”
15)	In terms of military history, the Battle of Actium was not the great battle that modern and ancient historians make it out to be. The perception of the battle as a momentous watershed in the history of Rome is the result of the efficiency of Augustan propaganda, which portrayed it as the mother of all battles, the war that delivered the Roman people from generations of civil war and suffering.
16)	This message was in line with Octavianic restoration propaganda, marking the beginning of an age of peace. Actium was promoted as the war that would end all wars, rather like the First World War
17)	In sum, the battle of Actium was decisive because it marked the end of the Republic, the beginning of the Empire and ascendancy of Octavian to the throne

v.	Before he died, another messenger arrived, with news the Cleopatra was still alive

19)	Rather than fall under Octavian’s domination, Cleopatra committed suicide, possibly by means of a poisonous asp. Octavian executed her son Caesarion, annexed Egypt, and used Cleopatra’s treasure to pay off his veterans 
20)	Octavian’s victory over Antony was advertised as a victory over Egypt, to resonate more positively with the Roman people and senate. Periochae of Livy Bk 133, Aftermath of battle of Alexandria

22)	Florus Epitome of History XXI. 11: The War Against Antonius and Cleopatra 1. “The madness of Antonius, since it could not be laid to rest by the satisfaction of his ambition, was brought to an end by his luxury and licentiousness. After the Parthian expedition he acquired a loathing for war and lived a life of ease, and a slave to his love for Cleopatra, rested in her royal arms as though all had gone well with him. 2 The Egyptian woman demanded the Roman Empire from the drunken general as the price of her favors; and this Antonius promised her, as though the Romans were more easily conquered than the Parthians. 3 He, therefore, began to aim at sovereignty- though not for himself - and that in no secret manner; but, forgetful of his country, his name, his toga and the emblems of his office, he soon completely degenerated into the monster which he became, in feeling as well as in garb and dress. In his hand was a golden sceptre, at his side a sabre; and he wore a purple robe studded with huge gems; a crown only was lacking to make him a king dallying with a queen. 4 At the first rumor of his latest proceedings Caesar had crossed over from Brundisium to meet the approach of war, and, pitching his camp in Epirus had surrounded all the shore of Actium, the island of Leucas, Mount Leucate and the promontories enclosing the Ambracian Gulf with a formidable fleet. 5 We had more than four hundred ships, the enemy less than two hundred; however, their size compensated for their numerical inferiority. For having from six to nine banks of oars and also rising high out of the water with towers and platforms, so as to resemble castles or cities, they made the sea groan and the wind labor as they moved along. Their very size, indeed, was fatal to them. 6 Caesar's ships had from two to six banks of oars and no more; being, therefore, easily handled for any maneuver that might be required, whether for attacking, backing water or tacking, they scattered, at their will, the opposing vessels, which were clumsy, and in every respect unwieldy, several of them attacking a single ship with missiles and with their beaks, and also with firebrands hurled into them.” 7. “The vastness of the enemy's forces was never more apparent than after the victory; for, as a result of the battle, the wreckage of the huge fleet floated all over the sea, and the waves, stirred by the winds, continually yielded up the purple and gold bespangled spoils of the Arabians and Sabaeans and a thousand other Asiatic peoples. 8. The queen led the retreat, putting out into the open sea in her golden vessel with purple sails. 9. Antonius soon followed her, but Caesar was hard upon his tracks. And so neither their preparations for flight into the Ocean, nor their occupation of the two promontories of Egypt, Paraetonium and Pelusium, with garrisons availed them aught; and they were almost within Caesar's grasp. Antonius was the first to seize the sword of a suicide; the queen, casting herself at Caesar's feet, tried to attract his glances, but in vain, for her beauty was unable to prevail over his self-control. 10 Cleopatra’s efforts were aimed not at saving her life, which was freely offered to her, but at obtaining a portion of his kingdom. Despairing of winning this from Caesar and perceiving that she was being reserved to figure in his triumph, profiting by the carelessness of her guard, she betook herself to the Mausoleum, as the royal sepulchre is called. 11. There, having put on the elaborate garments by the side of her beloved Antonius in a coffin filled with rich perfumes, and applying serpents to her veins, thus passed into death as into a sleep.”
23)	XXI. 12: “Epilogue” 1. “Thus, the civil wars came to an end; the other wars were waged against foreign nations and broke out in different quarters of the world, while the empire was distracted by its troubles. 2 Peace was a new state of affairs, and the proud and haughty necks of the nations, not yet accustomed to the reins of servitude, revolted against the yoke, recently imposed upon them. 3. It was in particular, the northern region, where there dwelt the Noricans, the Illyrians, the Pannonians, the Dalmatians, the Moesians, the Thracians, the Dacians, the Sarmatians and the Germans, that showed the most spirit.
Chapter 8: Augustus 1
8a. Introduction 
•	Principate is the term used for the early empire, and more specifically the reign of Augustus and his successors, the Julio Claudian emperors. It is derived from the Latin, princeps, for first or foremost (civitatis or citizen is understood). This is what Augustus called himself instead of dictator. The word prince comes from princeps.

•	In 28 BC Octavian and his consular colleague Agrippa held a census, the first since 70 BC. To do this, Octavian arrogated the potestas censoria (the power of the censor) to himself and to Agrippa; he also used this authority to launch moral reform and to reduce the number of senators from 1,000 to 800. As the leader of the senate and first on the list of senators, he called himself princeps senatus first of the senate (consuls had been called this in the Republic). With the Agreement of 27 BC, Octavian renounced his military powers and “transferred the state to the Roman people,” although he accepted control of the (armed, military) provinces of Spain, Gaul, and Syria for ten years; finally, he assumed the name of Augustus given to him by the senate.
•	Sources Publius Cornelius Tacitus was born in Gaul and had a successful senatorial career in Rome during the reigns of the Flavian emperors (AD 70-96). He was a praetor in 88, consul in 97, and proconsul of Asia in 112. After the murder of Domitian in 96, Tacitus wrote his two main historical works, the Histories and the Annals. He wrote the Histories from 105-109. They dealt with the rule of the Flavians (from the Year of the Four Emperors in 69 to the overthrow of Domitian in 96). We are concerned with the Annals, which cover the Julio-Claudians, for whom Tacitus had little regard, portraying them as weak tyrants. His negative characterization of Augustus and his successors is thus informed by the fact that while Tacitus was involved in statecraft, Rome was ruled by an oppressive autocrat (the emperor Domitian).
•	The Annals was published between AD 110-120, and consisted of 16 or 18 books, of which 1-4 and 12-15 are intact and 5, 6, 11 and 16 survive in fragments.* They cover the period from the accession of Tiberius in AD 14 to the death of Nero in 68, however they are premised on the belief that the military monarchy crafted by Augustus was a totalitarian autocracy, only disguised with the formalities and appearance of republican institutions and norms; thus, even if he does not include a book on Augustus, Tacitus is relevant to this module, which outlines the components of Augustus’ constitution, (a sham in Tacitus view). Tacitus argues that the assumption of power by Augustus’successors shows how firmly the monarchy was already institutionalized by the time of Augustus' death. Augustus, it is suggested, corrupted the people, the armies and the senate, but was generally accepted for his personal rule. Tacitus underlined the moral behavior evinced by his characters, and hence chose to focus on historical events not based on their political importance, but rather on the basis of whether the characters involved in the events, responded with moral courage and honesty, or whether they demonstrated obsequious, toady behavior in the face of autocratic emperors. In short Tacitus judged his characters according to the moral criteria established by annalistic historians, but even more rigorously. *The later reign of Tiberius the entire reign of Caligula are lost.
•	Suetonius Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus was born (in AD 70) in the province of Africa, in the town of Hippo Regius, in modern Algeria. He was a prominent figure in the imperial court of Rome, in the early 2nd century, and a scholar, who produced a range of works in the areas of biography, antiquarianism, and philology. Most survive only in fragmentary form. Suetonius is best known for his (best preserved) work, The Lives of the Caesars, individual biographies of the rulers of the Roman empire from Julius Caesar to Domitian. The genre of biography, which originated in Hellenistic Alexandria (Egypt), was taken up by the Romans in the mid first century AD. However, Suetonius is the first known writer of imperial biographies, and he is believed to have created this genre. His Lives is an important historical source for the early Empire and it includes material that reveals what contemporaries, and near-contemporaries of the emperors said about them. Consequently, The Lives of the Caesars is mostly anecdotal and not intended to deliver critical judgment or analysis. Rather it was meant to provide a vivid portrayal of all of the characteristics of his subjects, down to the physical; its inclusion of everything-that was said about a subject, including his appearance, the good and the bad, was a component of this genre, and it resulted in a very entertaining narrative, some of it lurid. Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars was imitated for biographies of emperors in late antiquity and even in the modern era.
•	De Vita Caesarum: The Lives of the Caesars were biographies of the twelve Caesars* from Julius Caesar to Domitian. Each life or biography was arranged thematically under different categories, like childhood, accession to power, accomplishments, public life, private life, personal characteristics, including physical appearance and death. The categories were supported by anecdotal evidence.
•	The Res Gestae Divi Augusti, The Achievements of the Deified Augustus was the official autobiography of Augustus from 31 BC to AD 14. As the full title indicates, the text is self-serving, propagandistic and it gives us an idea of how Augustus wanted to be remembered: The achievements of the deified Augustus by which he placed the whole world under the sovereignty of the Roman people, and of the amounts which he expended upon the state and the Roman people. The text was inscribed on two columns near the Mausoleum (Tomb) of Augustus in Rome, and in the Temple of Roma and Augustus in Ankara (ancient Ancyra) after Augustus’ death. It was an honorific inscription and a tribute to Augustus’ legacy, omitting the bad and exaggerating the good
•	Dio Cassius (aka Cassius Dio), ca. AD 150– 235. Dio started his literary activity in the 190s and wrote his Roman History in the years AD 211- 233. He was born at Nicaea in Bithynia in Asia Minor. Upon the death of his father (Roman governor of Cilicia) Dio went in AD 180 to Rome, entered the Senate, and under the emperor Commodus became a client and official of the imperial court. He held high offices, becoming a close friend of several Severan emperors. He was made governor of Pergamum and Smyrna; consul in 220; proconsul of Africa; governor of Dalmatia and then of Pannonia; and consul again in 229. Of the eighty books of Dio’s Roman History, covering the period from the landing of Aeneas in Italy to the reign of Alexander Severus (1, 184 BC to AD 235 ), we only possess Books 36 - 54 and 56–63 (with gaps); these cover the years 68 BC– AD 69. The missing parts are known (with gaps), from the epitomes by Zonaras, who relies closely on Dio, and for some later gaps, the epitomes by John Xiphilinus (both writing in the 11th century). Dio’s access to research material because of his official duties and his ambitious scope make him an important source for Roman history of the end of the republic and the first four emperors. The surviving books 56-63 cover Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. Dio followed the framework of Roman annalistic history in the manner of Tacitus.
•	Augustus and the Augustan Principle: 
o	Constitutional Consolidation and the Legalization of Power: 
o	After the deaths of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian looted the Ptolemaic treasuries and annexed Egypt to the Roman Empire 
o	Egypt was to be governed exclusively as an imperial possession by viceroys and special legates and prefects, who governed at the discretion of Octavian/Augustus 
o	Governed by a prefect: a military governor of equestrian rank 
o	Aware of the potential for wealth accumulation and troop recruitment that Egypt offered to whomever controlled it, Octavian refused to let the senate-anyone-event visit Egypt unless by his permission. Otherwise he made no changes in the east. He accepted the acta or arrangements that Antony had established 
o	Augustus had to resolve the following issues: How to deal with Antony’s troops? How to deal with the senate? How to re-shape the state? This would be a public policy and relations challenge. From the outset Octavian/Augustus took care of his public image and presented the new constitutional system couched in the old traditions of the Republic, to please the people and to allay any fears of the senate and the old aristocracy.
o	The first years of the region were concerned with regulating and legitimizing his position in Rome constitutionally. How to have absolute power (maintain imperium) without appearing as a director?  He started out in 31 BC by arrogating consecutive consulships to himself down until 27 BC, and then again to 23BC. 29BC Octavian had military triumphs for his victories. Horace and Virgil hailed him as the hero of the day and a great conqueror.  In honor of Octavian’s victories the senate consecrated the Temple of the divine, deified Julius Caesar. 
o	The propaganda: Restoration Propaganda
	PAX ROMANA PAX AUGUSTA
	The relief of peace after civil war 
	Prosperity that comes with peace 
	The restoration of peace and the pax romana were also framed in a moral discourse: 
•	The civil wars had been a symptom of immoral times marked by crossing of all societal boundaries 
•	Pax Augusta: the peace and prosperity that came with compliance with Augustan social and religious programs 
o	Other Issues Octavian has to resolve: 
	The problem with German tribes poised on the  Rhine, and ready to enter eastern Gual. It would soon be necessary to mandate defensive works along the west bank of the Rhine and campaign against the Germans in Germania Magna, on the east side of the Rhine. 
	The Roman army had become too large and it needed to be reduced for the sake of stability at home, since there were supposed to the peaceful times. Octavian disbanded over half of his and Antony’s Legions, paid them and settled them with the money he had taken from Egypt. This allowed him to avoid proscriptions, which would not have set the right tone in what was presented as a kinder and gentler time. 
	Octavian had to create a strong central government that would be acceptable to the senate and the Roman people. For his own image he also wanted to revie the prestige of the senate and the old Republican families. He planned to create: 
•	A cabinet system of government wherein as chief of state he would maintain control over the armies. 
•	An imperial civil service that would regulate public finance, administer the provinces and oversee foreign and domestic policy. 
	Finally Octavian planned to establish a monarchy, based on hereditary succession, ie bloodlines. Octavian’s affiliation with Julius Caesar had given him great auctoritas. That the soul of Caesar had been transformed into a comet, the Sidum Julium, made Octavian popular with the urban masses. 
o	 Titles: Octavian assumed the title of imperator to emphasize his military strength. 
	This became the standard title that Roman rulers took from now on [next rex!]
	From 31 to 23 BC
	Octavian’s power and authority were based on holding consecutive consulships and consequently having continuous pro-consular imperium throughout the Empire. 
	He also had the tribunician sacrosanctity: the protective “shield” (bodily inviolability) of the plebeian tribuneship. 
o	In 28 BC Octavian named Agrippa as his consular colleague, He needed Agrippa’s administrative and engineering skills. Octavian and Agrippa obtained a grant of censorial potestas to undertake a massive census; to have sought the censorship might have seemed dictatorial. Control of the census allowed Octavian to reduce the senate from 1000 to 800. It also gave Octavian authority to mandate moral reform;  he may have tried to carry a bill to law in 28BC. 
8b. Constitutional arrangements 
•	Constitutional Arrangements 
o	In 28 BC Octavian began to implement changes to the constitution of the state: these arrangements or formulae were subtle and intended not to disturb the existing organization and operation of government. Writing in the Res Gestae years later, he wrote “In my sixth (28 BC) and my seventh (27 BC) consulship, after I had extinguished the fires of civil war, in accordance with the wishes of all my fellow citizens, having taken control of all things, I transferred the ‘supreme authority’ from my power to the arbitration of the Roman Senate and the Roman people” (RG 34. 1). This process of change was promoted as a return to normalcy after years of abnormality
•	The so-called Settlement of 27 BC 
o	In fact, the constitutional Settlement of 27 was little more than political theater: essentially Augustus continued to share the consulship, with a colleague, in the traditional manner, as he had been doing for years; he also announced that the rulings of the Triumvirs would be abolished at the end of the year (Dio 53. 2.5; Suet. Aug. 28.2). Octavian had gone to the Senate to negotiate and consolidate his constitutional powers and position, calling it the Restoration of the Republic, and the Reorganization of the Government. 
	1. He arrogated proconsular imperium to himself for 10 years (to maintain his authority outside the city boundary (pomerium) of Rome. 
	2. He arrogated consecutive consulships to himself until 23 BC (to maintain his authority inside the pomerium of Rome).
	3. Octavian also took control of the armies: First, he renounced all his powers and handed over his provinces to the senate and the Roman people. When the plan was greeted with polite protest, Octavian reluctantly agreed to undertake the administration of only the large provinces like the Spains, Gaul and Syria, where all the legions happened to be garrisoned (!) The new arrangement gave Octavian control over all the military provinces; his grip on the military was secure: he had effectively made himself commander in chief of the armed forces, which would be the basis of his power in a what was to be essentially a military monarchy. He also vowed to campaign only for defense and peace keeping..
•	The remaining unarmed provinces would be governed by the senate the magistrates, who would be chosen by and be responsible to the senate. This arrangement made the senate feel that its authority had been enhanced. It had authority over several provinces, although no military power, since these provinces were unarmed. 
•	Imperial provinces: military provinces controlled by the emperor
•	Senatorial provinces: non military provinces controlled by the senate 
•	Legate: military governor of an imperial province, hand-picked by the emperpr from the senatorial class 
•	Proconsul: a governor of a senatorial province, chosen by the senate, from the senatorial class. 
•	Notable Exceptions: 
o	Egypt: imperial but governed by an equestrian prefect chosen from the equestrian class by the emperor 
o	North Africa: senatorial, but armed with one legion 
•	New Name and New Title 27 BC In response to what appeared to be a gesture of modesty and moderation, a very grateful and relieved senate heaped more honors on Octavian and renamed him Augustus. The senate also called him princeps civitatis or first leader of the state. The term Principate is used to refer to Augustus’ reign. Princeps (prince) is used to refer to the emperor. “Augustus” means venerable, revered and wise; it also evoked the tradition (found in the 3rd c BC epic poet and dramatist, Ennius), of Romulus’ foundation of Rome with “august augury” (venerated divination).
•	Augustus took more measures to please the senate, by restoring to it, control over treasury and allowing it to function as a supreme court over cases of extortion in senatorial provinces and in Italy. Although he continued to recognize the popular assemblies as legislative bodies, he permitted the Senate to issue decrees with force of law, without ratification of the people. By allowing the sente to become a “full partner” in the government he had promoted the false ideal of dyarchy: But no one was on an equal footing with the commander of the armed forces. Tacitus though the dyarchy was a sham. 
•	In 26 BC Augustus contracted a serious illness in Spain after the first of his campaigns there, and he continued to be ill from 25 BC, down to his formal resignation of the consulship in July of 23 BC. Proof that he thought he was dying is found in the Mausoleum (tomb), which he started in earnest to build for himself at this time (8e), as well as his decision to begin writing his autobiography and the Res Gestae. It has been argued that Augustus’ belief in his imminent death led him to make changes to the constitution, with his legacy in mind. In 26 BC as mentioned, Augustus was in poor health, having campaigned first in Gaul, then in Spain; in winter of 25 or 24 BC he returned to Rome, and began his tenth consulship. The Senate took an oath to uphold Augustus’ acta, and he distributed grants of 400 sestertii per person to the plebs.
•	Dio reports (53.28.2) that in 24 BC the Senate “released Augustus from all compulsion of the laws” which meant Augustus was to be “master of himself and the laws and do what he liked and not do what he did not like;” Dio remarks elsewhere (53. 18. 1) that the emperor is “absolved from the laws.” These statements imply the start of a constitutional autocracy at Rome, although Dio was writing much later (early 3rd c. AD) when arguably the autocracy of the emperor was more firmly entrenched in the constitutional arrangements of imperial power.
•	However, 23 BC was a year of crisis, because Augustus at 40 years of age, almost died, and his nephew and heir apparent, Marcellus did die; these events and the troubles of 23 BC led Augustus to revise his constitutional position and provide for the succession (see 9a) In fact, during 23 and 22 BC there were food shortages and plague all over Italy, which led to political unrest in Rome. The condition of the plebs of Rome, including freedmen was becoming problematic because this constituency had acquired some political currency and leverage. In addition, the urban mob was angry and called on Augustus take more absolute powers than he had ever had: a dictatorship was out of the question, as Augustus had learned from Caesar’s end (!)
•	The so-called “Trial of Marcus Primus” and the “Conspiracy of Caepio and Murena” (Dio 54.3) 23 BC (?) Most historians date these two crises (reported by Dio in his book for the year 22 BC), in the year 23 BC.* They claim that these events were the result of an increasingly bold and effective opposition, which almost brought the regime down and forced Augustus to fashion a constitutional retreat, a do-over or revision. Historians also invoke the Fasti Capitolini** for 23 BC, which document as consul, a Terentius Varro Murena, who was replaced by Calpurnius Piso, after being condemned and removed from office, according to one reading of the inscription.
•	Some historians have even argued that the troubles of 23 BC may have led Augustus to fake his illness to incentivize any opposing forces to fall in line with him, although it seems reasonable that early in 23, Augustus did not expect to survive, and we could argue that illness does not promote political stability (i.e., why would he do that?). The matter of whether these events occurred in 23 or 22 BC remains controversial and I will follow the predominant dating of 23 BC. Dio reports the treason court was convened for several cases at this time (23/22): Marcus Primus, the proconsul of Macedonia, was convicted of treason for making war in Thrace, unprovoked and without authority. Primus claimed he did so at the behest of Augustus, however Augustus intervened and denied it at the tribunal; the jury was divided, and when the defense counsel questioned the emperor’s right to intervene, Augustus replied that his justification was “the public interest” (Dio 54.3.1-3).
•	Following the trial of Primus, a conspiracy was organized by two men, presumably to seek redress for Primus, their political ally, who had in the meantime quietly gone into exile. It is reasonable to assume that these men were expressing disapproval of Augustus for turning against Primus, who was supposed to have been a good friend of the emperor (Dio 54.3.4-8; Veil. Pat. 2. 91.2). One of the conspirators was Fannius Caepio (whom we know nothing about); the other was Licinius Murena or Varro Murena (there are variations of the name), connected with a group close to Augustus. Murena was the brother, or half brother, of Terentia, the wife of Gaius Maecenas, Augustus’ great friend and agent (7b). Another equestrian supporter of Augustus, Gaius Proculeius, was also involved as the defense counsel, who had questioned Augustus at Marcus Primus’ trial.
•	The charge was not trumped up by Augustus: Suetonius’ account suggests that he was upset by it (56. 4); there was a formal trial for treason, and a conviction, but again the verdict was divided. The disturbing detail of this event is that the convicted men were not permitted to go quietly into exile as had been the case in the past, for nobles and senators, including Primus; Caepio and Murena were apprehended and executed. Suetonius reports Maecenas, who was close to Augustus, had tipped off his wife and told her to warn her (half) brother Murena to flee, (Suet. 66.3), and that as a result, Maecenas lost his favorable standing with Augustus. The sources imply that Terentia, Maeceans’ wife, who was allegedly having an affair with Augustus, told the emperor she had been warned by her husband; Augustus celebrated his delivery from the plot as a victory, but he was evidently angry that the verdict (to condemn) was not unanimous (!)
•	The so-called Settlement of 23 BC It was either before these crises or in their aftermath (depending on how we date them) that Augustus redefined his own powers, with what is known as the Settlement of 23 BC. In 23 BC Augustus laid down his 11th consulship and declared that in the following years he would not be candidate for the consulship; however, alternative arrangements were adopted to give him the powers that he was losing by giving it up: Augustus did not change the strength of his power; his totalitarian power was a given; rather he was modifying the “expression” of his power. In 23 the fundamental issue was the restoration of the consulship to the aristocracy: it had been monopolized by the princeps; the new arrangement for his authority and that of his successors would be proconsular imperium (maius)* and the power of the tribune, the tribunicia potestas.
•	The building blocks of Augustus’ authority in the Settlement of 23 BC: 1. Augustus received a grant, annually but renewable for life, of the official powers of the tribune of the plebs, the tribunicia potestas; constitutionally, this power allowed Augustus to introduce legislation; tribunicia potestas was a set of specifically defined powers, which Augustus used throughout his reign to legislate. 2. The imperium of Augustus was also redefined: it became imperium maius, which gave him authority over all the provincial governors; but it was also called proconsular imperium, as opposed to bona fide consular imperium; however, it was perpetual, meaning he had it every time he entered the pomerium (boundary) of Rome, and he did not have to renew it when he left Rome because he also had imperium maius. I.e., combined with imperium maius, his proconsular imperium gave him executive power anywhere in the empire; (Dio 53 . 3. 2. 5); proconsular imperium (maius) overrode all forms of imperium.
•	According to the terms of the Settlement of 23 BC: Augustus renounced the consulship, so that the senators and equestrians could compete for it, as in republican times; renunciation of the consulship was strategic politically, because it enhanced his image with the nobility, which now felt entitled to run for the two consulships in the traditional manner. 
o	To maintain perpetual authority inside and outside of Rome, with his proconsular imperium, Augustus took imperium maius (the combination was called proconsular imperium maius) This imperium was greater than that of any other proconsul; it brought perpetual, preeminent, overriding proconsular imperium inside and outside of the pomerium (sacred boundary of Rome). Augustus' proconsular imperium maius did not lapse when he exited and re-entered Rome: we can think of it as special proconsular imperium enhanced with imperium maius.
o	To ensure his authority in Rome with the people and the popular assemblies, Augustus obtained the tribunician power. He had refused this in 3nd 32 BC, keeping only the sacrosanctity of the office 
•	The so-called Agreement of 19 BC and the “Conspiracy” of Marcus Egnatius Rufus In the following years, disease and hunger disrupted Rome, and the urban plebs had gained currency under M. Egnatius Rufus, a senator who had appointed himself to the role of the peoples’ champion. Augustus was away from Rome (with Livia touring the eastern Mediterranean), but violence in the city led him to return to Rome in October of 19 BC, where he faced another ‘conspiracy’ according to Velleius Paterculus (2.91-92) and Dio (53.24.4-6). In 22 BC as aedile, Rufus had won the favor of the Roman plebs by organizing and funding a fire brigade; unlike the fire brigade of Licinius Crassus, which only put out fires for payment, Egnatius made his slaves available to put out fires for free. Because of the frequency of fires in Rome, he became enormously popular and was elected praetor the following year in 21 BC, in contravention of the Villian Laws regulating the age and required period between magistracies. Emboldened by his meteoric ascendancy, Rufus made a bid in 19 BC for the consulship (for 18); the plebeian mob supported him with military force in the streets, and its violence evidently threatened the senate, for it invoked the SCU to eliminate him
•	Now in 19 BC Gaius Sentius Saturninus was sole consul because in the previous year (20 BC), the plebs had refused to elect more than one consul in the comitia; he was also in charge of elections and had to face the rise of the peoples’ champion alone. Augustus may have been thinking about taking the vacant consulship in 19 BC, but he was away when the trouble arose. In any case, Rufus’ bid for the consulship is treated in the sources like another conspiracy against Augustus. The emperor and the senate refused to accept his candidacy, and they deputed Saturninus, as consul, to take action in Rome against Rufus in the meantime. When Rufus was ordered to step away from his bid for the consulship, he refused, and there were mob riots in the streets; this violence led the senate to take extreme measures: it passed the Senatus Consultum Ultimum and ordered Saturninus to prosecute Rufus for treason, imprison him and execute him. In sum, the senate and Augustus regarded Rufus and this type of demagoguery as dangerous, and they acted decisively; Augustus returned to Rome and appointed consuls for the rest of the year. The fact that Augustus mentioned the conspiracy “against Augustus” and execution of Rufus in the Res Gestae (11) reveals the danger was significant to the emperor.
•	Augustus had removed a troublesome senator, who arguably was also a rival of his for the support of the plebs, which was important. In addition, the fact that the conservative senate needed Augustus to take decisive action and could not control the opposition of the plebs in the streets is revealed by the senate’s offer at this point, of a dictatorship to Augustus, which he renounced: just as Caesar had publicly renounced a kingship at the Lupercalia festival, so Augustus refused a dictatorship publicly at the Lupercalia festival (Dio 14. I. 4-5; Suet. 52).
•	Agreement of 19 BC gave Augustus more dictatorial authority: In 19 BC the senate countered with the following constitutional grants for Augustus which Dio (54.10.5-6) lists: 
o	An appointment of the “overseership of morality” (Praefectura Morum or administrative jurisdiction over morals), meaning perpetual censorial authority. 
o	A special consulship: a special grant of consular power for life, and the right to enact any laws he might wish, presumably without submitting them to the comitiae (popular assemblies); he also obtained permission to call them the leges Augustae. In sum, the Settlement of 19 BC gave Augustus a censorship for life and a “special” consulship, which was perpetual like his Tribunician Power.
•	Formalities 1. As princeps, Augustus was also princeps senatus (first in the senate); thus, it was his duty to convene the senate; however, when he was no longer consul, and the senate had felt it was beneath its dignity to be convened by a mere tribune; the special perpetual consulship mitigated this formality. 2. In addition, the people wanted the princeps to be more visible: consequently, Augustus presided as special perpetual consul with the regular elected consuls as an “honorary consul.” a. He also had his own special consular seat: the sella curulis, a special throne and symbol of the political and military imperium of a magistrate. b. He held 12 of the 24 fasces (other two consuls got 6 each), the bundles of rods with an axe, which were also a symbol of a magistrate’s imperium.
o	Fasces: Bundles of rods with axe: symbolized a magistrate’s and eventually the emperor’s imperium 
o	More powers and honors: In 12 BC when Lepidus died Augustus appointed himself Pontifex Maximus; thereafter all emperors took the office. Soon after this, Augustus assumed control of the mint. And in 2 BC he received the title Pater Patriae (father of the country).
•	Destinatio “Reforms” of the Popular Assembly were undertaken in AD 4. A system called Destinatio was introduced for electing consuls and praetors in the popular assembly (comitia centuriata). The system was rigged: Augustan partisans were given voting seniority, and they voted based on his recommendations. A select 10 centuries (voting units made up of equestrians and senators who were clients of Augustus) voted for nominees on a short list that had been prepared for them by Augustus. The remaining voting units in the Assembly were instructed to follow the directive of the special, elite voting units or centuries.
8c. Admin and social reforms 
•	Evolution of a Cabinet System of Government In 27 BC Augustus also created a special administrative committee of the senate to assist in preparing agendas for meetings, however it did not make policy decisions. 
•	Consilium (Proto-Cabinet) The true predecessor of the Imperial Cabinet was the Consilium, a more elite group of close friends of Augustus and high ranking senators, legal experts and other specialists. It met privately, debated and established policy, and developed the legislation to be presented to the popular assemblies; the Consilium also recommended candidates for the magistracies and the senate.
•	Imerial Civil Service: Augustus created a permanent civil service. He started this project early in his region, and it was still not completed at his death. Augustus built up a trained and salaried staff: the civil bureaucracy handled: grain supply, grain dole, construction, the maintenance of building and streets, preservation of law and order, management of imperial estates, tax collection, and the new postal system 
•	In his civil bureaucracy Augustus employed people of every social class: senators, equestrians, freedmen and even slaves. Most senators served as heads of commissions and ministers of branches of government. The majority of top-ranking administrative posts was filled by equestrians. The equestrians had the expertise to manage financial matters and they were eager to join the new regulated, but legitimate system in order to advance their careers.
•	Promotion of Equestrains 
o	More reliable than senators because they were more dependant on emperor’s favorable patronage for their future advancement
o	They were efficient because of their financial backgrounds and entreprenurual skills. Some chose military carrers: garrison duty in Egypt, which was off limits to senators, as a special imperial province. Many began careers in the military, and moved on to become imperial administrative agents in the provinces, and the count, called procurators. 
•	Promotion of Freedmen 
o	Augustus had inherited from Caesar a large body of trained slaves and freedmen who would form the nucleus of the imperial bureaucracy. Some freedmen ultimately attained positions that were more powerful than those held by equestrians and senators. At first, freedmen performed menial duties, but because of their loyalty, industry and literacy they soon occupied more important positions.
o	The bureaucratic task of imperial correspondence became the monopoly of freedmen in the Augustan principate. Clerks, accountants and auditors were usually freedmen. The fact that freedmen controlled the secretarial bureaucracy gave them a great deal of discretionary power. For example, they were in charge of reading petitions from all over the Empire. Freedmen functioned as advisors to the Emperor, and they knew everything because they read everyone's mail (!). Gradually the Augustan civil service even included slaves.
•	Social Reforms
o	Augustus believed that of Rome was to be a worthy leader of Italy and the empire, upper class roman society would have to reform its ways
o	There would be no more of the lax moral behavior of the late Republic 
o	Consequently he passed laws, unfair and illogical, that made private matters public crimes 
o	Familt-pietas (loyalty) values were pitted against national pietas and the law 
o	Pitting family against state
•	A Moral Legislation: Julian Papian Laws 
o	Julian Papian Laws ( the entire body of morals and marriage laws). Augustus introduced legislation that was designed: 
	To stabilize and encourage the institution of marriage 
	To discourage marital infidelity and childlessness. The laws affected the upper classes; why? 
o	Penalties involved restricting access to family assets: the poor didn’t have assets
o	Poor were too busy trying to survive to commit adultery 
•	1. Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis 18 BC (the Julian law to repress adultery); this law made adultery a public crime. Husbands of adulterous wives could be prosecuted for pimping (lenocinium) if they did not turn their wives into the authorities and initiate divorce proceedings. Penalties were severe and included confiscations and exile. The laws eventually politicized the imperial family: Julio-Claudian women and men were held up as a moral standard of respectability, and as examples of upper-class family values. Augustus was obliged to exile his own daughter, Julia, and his granddaughter for committing this offence.
•	2. Lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus: the Julian law to regulate marriage; the original law was passed in 18 BC: i. It recognized marriages between freeborn and freed, breaking down the barrier of marriage between these two classes. ii. It penalized unmarried individuals and childless couples by limiting their right: a. to inherit property and leave assets to heirs. b. to advance socially and politically. In AD 9 the original law was emended and replaced by a new law, known as the Lex Papia Poppaea, which appears to have loosened some of the restrictions; hence “Julian Papian” for the entire package of laws.
•	The census figures of AD 13 were admittedly a million higher than those of 28 BC. However, this was due more to the peace and prosperity of the times* than to Augustus’ legislation. Augustus himself even admitted that the marriage laws were not effective. However, they did enrich the imperial treasuries with penalty fines. They were designed to diminish political patronage and corruption, but in fact, they promoted it because Augustus exempted friends and clients in return for various political and other favors. They also led to a special class of paid informers called the delatores, who would come to be hated.
•	How did Augustus pass the morals and marriage laws? He used the tribunician power and the Cura Legum et Morum:* Care or stewardship of laws and morals. Augustus made himself curator (aka praefectus) legum et morum in 19 BC. Caesar had taken this office in 45 BC, and in 44 BC, for life. This version of censorial power gave to Augustus, as it had given to Caesar, the right to intrude into the private lives of the upper classes. *This is similar to and would have come under the authority the Praefectura Morum, provided by the Agreement of 19 BC (8b, 21)
•	Legislation pertaining to the manumission of slaves 
o	Other social legislation was aimed at regulating the manumission of salves in order to maintain the racial purity of the Italian race and collect fines on illegal manumissions 
o	This mandate was inconsistent with the marriage law that broke down the barrier better free born and freed 
•	Lex Junia of 17 BC
o	In order to evade taxes, some slave owners had adopted informal methods of manumission, which were not legal 
o	The Lex Junia was intended to define the status of these illegally manumitted salves more precisely, and act as a disincentive 
o	Lex Junia gave objects of illegal manumission quasi freedom: an intermediate status between slave and freedman called: Junian Status or Intermediate Latin status 
o	Individulas with Intermediate Latin status had limited rights: not all the privileges of freedmen or full Latins
o	Junian Latins could not receive inheritances or legacies, and they could not make wills. However, since it is not certain if Latins and freedmen could receive inheritances and make wills, the matter of which social class had more rights is debatable. Latins* had limited voting rights, but they lived too far away from Rome to exercise them in the popular assemblies. Freedmen had no vote, but their children were automatically free-born citizens, so they were on a faster track to the citizenship. The children of Latins had to marry Roman citizens to become citizens.
o	Augustus and Freedmen Freedmen were not enfranchised; they did not have the franchise, or vote; thus, they were not citizens. However, Augustus promoted them in new ways. Many freedmen were absorbed into the civil bureaucracy. In Rome and the Italian towns, freedmen could be involved in the cult of the genius of Augustus,* local entertainments, many entrepreneurial activities and businesses, and several social clubs for freedmen created by Augustus. Finally, freedmen could serve in the navy, the fire department, and the provincial (auxiliary) armies.
•	Lex Fufia Canina 2 BC 
o	This law: a. Limited the number of slaves that an owner could informally manumit (free) in his will to a proportion of the total number of slaves owned (i.e., a proportional limit). b. Imposed a tax of 5 % (of the value of the slave) of all those above this proportional number. 
•	Lex Alia Sentia AD 4 
o	This law set all necessary criteria for the legal manumission of slaves: any manumissions that did not conform to these rules were subject to fines and taxes.
•	Inconsistency in manumission laws and marriage laws: The purpose of the laws on slave manumissions was, among other thing, to precent slaves from intermarrying with Italians, by controlling the number of manumissions, and the status of the illegally manumitted slaves more closely. I.e purpose was racist, to keep Italian blood unpolluted. Yet the marriage laws were supposed to break down the barrier between freed and free-born. Provisions regarding who could marry whom supported marriage between freed and free-born (the only exception was for men and women of senatorial rank who were not permitted to marry freedmen or freedwomen. 
8d. Religious reforms 
In his reformation of state religion Augustus resurrected ancient ceremonies and priesthoods that had been neglected for many years. Augustus wanted to rekindle certain old-fashioned religious cults and practices that had fallen out of use. His policies were aimed at promoting the collective pietas* of the people, rich and poor. Chief among these was the desire to ensure prosperity for men by securing the pax deorum, the peace and favor of the gods. *pietas: piety, love of the gods, country and family.
o	Aeneas Augustus promoted Aeneas, the Trojan prince and ancestor of the Romans, who fled from burning Troy, sailed to Italy, and established Lavinium in Latium. His son Ascanius, founded the city of Alba Longa and established the Alban dynasty of kings, who were in “fact” the ancestors of Romulus, the first king of Rome. Aeneas was also the embodiment of pietas, loyalty to family and to country, an important human value to the Romans; like Julius Caesar, Augustus promoted his lineage back to Aeneas, through the Julian clan. But all the Romans considered themselves to be the descendants of Aeneas.
o	Aeneas received three prophecies from the goddess Juno. As an oikist (a colonist and founder of a city or kingdom), Aeneas received a prophecy (a sacred prediction), informing him of where and how he and his son would find their future kingdoms. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (I 55-57) reports that after they arrived, Aeneas and his son, Ascanius were to be led by an animal to the site of Aeneas’ future city, Lavinium. Aeneas brought out a shrine with small figurines representing the Penates, the house-hold protective gods, and they prepared to make a sacrifice, where he saw the animal for the first time, on the coast; it was a pregnant white sow. However, she ran away before they could perform the sacrifice; Aeneas followed her inland where, she stopped, and gave birth.
o	After the birth, a second prophecy was revealed to Aeneas, instructing him to sacrifice the sow and her young, and build a city on the site where she had given birth (this was Lavinium). It also revealed that Aeneas’son Ascanius would be led to an even greater city (Alba Longa) in as many years after Aeneas’ sacrifice, as the number of piglets that were borne by the sow. Aeneas again made preparations for a sacrifice, and this time the sow was slain with her thirty piglets. Aeneas built his town, Lavinium, where he had sacrificed the sow. Thirty year later, Ascanius received a (third) prophecy, leading him to the site, where he established the city of Alba Longa and the Alban dynasty of kings, the ancestors of Romulus. The Roman myth-makers created the Alban kings to connect the Roman people and Romulus all the way back to Aeneas and the Trojans.
o	Aeneas is shown (with his head covered) preparing to sacrifice to the goddess Juno: he is attended by two assistants (camilli) and a figure at the right, who is identified as Ascanius; Aeneas also sacrificed to the Penates, protective household gods connected to family and ancestors, shown here seated in a shrine in the background at the left (Dionysius of Halicarnassus 1. 55. 4–57. 1;Verg. Aen. 8. 81. 5).
o	Aeneas prepares to sacrifice at the place where he saw the white sow for the first or the second time: this detail is disputed; the figure at the right is usually identified as his son and wears a Trojan robe and holds a shepherd's crook .
o	Rome’s piety and safety were ensured by observing the traditional religious cults: Augustan peace depended on the peace of the gods [pax deorum];Augustan peace and the pax deorum would bring Augustan prosperity, including fertility and its rewards (political and social). The propaganda promoted the significance of the Pax Augusta in the context of religion and moral behavior:
o	Pontifex Maximus In 12 BC when Lepidus died* Augustus became Pontifex Maximus. As Pontifex Maximus Augustus was the head priest of the sacred college and order of the pontiffs. Augustus also controlled augury. As emperor Augustus promoted the cult of Apollo Delphinos (of Delphi: prophecy and the oracle) and the cult of Apollo Virtus (as the virtue of the army and the ideal of noble and legitimate conquest).
o	As Pontifex Maximus Augustus increased the benefits and privileges of the Vestal Virgins 
o	Arval Brethern: Ambarvalia: Dea Dia 
o	Augustus Restored the Arval Brethren, an Ancient religious society 
o	It led the people each year in the Ambarvalia, an old fashioned harvest celebration of crops, in honor of a primitive goddess of the fields, known as Dea Dia
o	Membership was an important patronage appointment: its members were partisans and friends fo Augustus
o	17 BC Ludi Saeculares
o	Augustus reinstituted the Ludi Saeculares, a public religious thanksgiving and expiation ceremony with games
o	This ceremony followed closely after the legislation of 19 BC and drew together all hopes for a :New Age”
o	It reminded folks that the observance of tranditional religious ceremonial and rites was central to the Pax Augusta 
o	Augustus had completed his sweeping program of reform and the constitutional consolidation of his power 
o	Games, ritual purifications and thanksgiving were a fitting tribute to this achievement 
o	Women and children participated 
o	In 9 BC Augustus completed the Ara Pacis Augustae: The Altar of Augustan peace 
o	Now Augustus politicized his family by showing it in a public context as an example of piety and family values 
o	It was also a visual tribute to Augustan social programs and the Pax Augusta 
o	Reliefs show members of royal family (including children) participating in ground breaking ceremonies ( specific or generic) for the building in 13 BC probably a consecration ceremony (consecration) or a thanksgiving (supplication) 
o	Other panels portray scenes from the Foundation tradition and allegories of important Augustan ideals
o	They are iconic: both worthy of reverence and symbolic 
o	Ara Pacis was built in the Campus Martius, a military setting. The shadow of an obelisk (spoliated from Egypt after the defeat of Antony at Alexandrai) is believed to have functioned as the needle or dial of the horologium ( sun dial clock)
o	Lares and Penates: Augustus revived the Lares, the protective gods that guarded the crossroads and peoples’ homes. They were similar to, and often worshipped with the Penates, also protective gods, connected to one’s family and ancestors.
o	Cult of the Genius of Augustus Augustus connected the worship of the Lares to the worship of the Genius of Augustus. The Genius of Augustus was his living protective spirit. Augustus’ genius guided, guarded and protected the individual worshipper and promoted his family and fortune. The cult of the Lares and the Genius of Augustus encouraged the popular worship of the Emperor as a guardian angel.
o	In Rome the worship of the cult of the Lares and the genius of augustus was placed under the supervision of the vicomagistri (precinct heads) who were exclusively freedmen 
o	In the Italian towns, the Cult of the Lares and the Genius of Augustus was tended by the Severi Augustales, who were also exclusively freedmen. The cult of the Lares allowed freedmen to participate in the supervision of Roman religious rites. It brought a personal cult of the protection of Augustus to the people.
o	Sanctuary of Genius of Augustus in Pompeii: To have sought the peoples’ worship of him more directly would have contradicited the nature of the Augustan Principate and Roman notions of individual sanctity 
o	A bona fide cult of Augustus was not consonant with the traditional Roman rejection of theocracies: a living emperor could not be divine. Caesar’s Cult of Clemency was frowned upon by the nobility 
o	To worship a living Emperor as a divinity was a sacrilege in the Roman west. It evoked a theocracy ( a system in which the ruler was worshipped as a living god). The east was different because of the legacy of ruler cults from Hellenistic times. 
o	Freedmen and the Pax Deorum In sum, the combination of the worship of the Lares with the Genius of Augustus consolidated the emperor’s popular adulation without crossing the line over to eastern-ruler cult and quasi-theocracy. In AD 14 Tiberius, Augustus’ successor dedicated an altar to the Numen Augusti, the deified spirit of Augustus, after his death. Like Caesar, Augustus was deified after his death, posthumously. In the Roman west one had to be dead to be divine.
8e. Mausoleum of Augustus 
o	I. The History of the Monument The mausoleum of Augustus was erected in the Campus Martius as a dynastic rather than as a personal monument. By the imperial period it had become the custom to grant the privilege of burial in the Campus Martius to distinguished families by special decree of the senate. In 28 BC Augustus commissioned the Mausoleum*and subsequently began placing the remains of the imperial family in it (Suet. Aug. 100); Strabo V. 3. 8). His successors, the Julio-Claudians, followed him. The literary evidence suggests that the Mausoleum was the resting place of emperors* and their families until the 2nd c. AD. By the 4th c AD, the sources cease to report burials or mention the monument.* *Construction began a couple of years later. **The emperor Hadrian built his own Mausoleum which housed his tomb and those of the Antonine emperors, and by association the Severan emperors.
o	We know little about the circumstances of the destruction of the Mausoleum. The obelisks that adorned the entrance are mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote in the 4th c. AD, but the mausoleum itself is not mentioned in his list of the monuments of the region of Rome ( IX) in which it was located. In addition, a story of its plundering by Alaric (king of the Visigoths) in the early 5th c (410) cannot be substantiated. In the Middle Ages it was called the Mons Augustus (10th to 12th c.) and the portus Aguste or Austu (13th c.) In the 12th century it was quarried or spoliated for its stone: its marble veneer was stripped and shipped for the construction of the Cathedral of Orvieto. What remained in Rome was converted into a fortress, and its destruction in 1167 led to serious damage to the ruins. However, the fortifications were repaired in 1241.
o	By the sixteenth century the Mausoleum had become a garden; it then belonged to several aristocratic Renaissance families. An excavation of the monument was made in 1793, about which little is known. Early in the 19th century a circus was established on the site of the garden. In the early 20th century, the interior of the Mausoleum was used as a concert hall called the Augusteo. Benito Mussolini closed it in the 1930’s and made it an archaeological site. The restoration of the Mausoleum was intended to promote Mussolini's policies of restoring ancient monuments of Roman Italy and Libya, which he now occupied, to highlight the glory of Rome and by association, the dominance of Italian Fascism.
o	II. Description of Plan
o	The Mausoleum was circular in plan and consisted of several concentric rings of earth and brick, faced with travertine and marble on the exterior, and planted with cypress trees on the top tier. The whole structure is believed to have been capped by a conical roof and a huge bronze statue of Augustus.
o	The red granite obelisks flanking the entrance have been removed; one now stands at the Piazza dell’ Esquiline (right) on the north-west side of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiora; and the other (left) is located at the Quirinal fountain
o	The completed monument measured 90 m in diameter by 42 m in height. This aerial view of the mausoleum shows the central cylinder which houses Augustus's burial chamber
o	Within the walls this central chamber housed the burials of the emperor and some family members; it is encircled by chambers containing urns with the remains of other family members.
o	A corridor ran from the entryway into the central chamber, around which there were the chambers with niches to hold urns containing the ashes of imperial family members.
o	Surrounding the mausoleum was landscaped parkland, like a modern public park, providing sanctuary or a place to rest in the Campus Martius.
o	Jan Goeree, A Reconstruction of the Mausoleum of Augustus and a View of the Ruins, before 1704, pen and black ink, brush and brown wash and red chalk (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)
o	The Propaganda of the Mausoleum of Augustus The Mausoleum of Augustus was built by Augustus* to house his own cremated remains and those of chosen family and friends; however, the structure, its design and decoration were intended to highlight the greatness of Augustus. The monument itself topped by an earthen dome and its function were intended to evoke a similar tomb called the Mausoleum of the Anatolian dynast Mausolus, in Halicarnassus; it was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world (Strabo 5.3.9). For Augustus, his mausoleum was a means of leaving a monument to his legacy, both literally and figuratively. The Mausoleum is believed to have been among his first projects he planned. Work began in 28 BC after his victories over Antony in the Battles of Actium and Alexandria. Augustus took great care to promote his public image as a restorer and protector of the Roman Republic. The great mausoleum project underlined this message of the restoration of order after troubled civil war, what we have referred to as his restoration propaganda. *technically in 28 BC he was still called Octavian
o	Speculative 19th reconstructions of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassos from Sir Banister Fletcher, A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method for Students, Craftsmen & Amateurs (London, : B. T. Batsford, 1924), page 113
o	Thus, when it was first constructed the Mausoleum played a political role against Mark Antony by reminding the people and the senate of his marriage to Cleopatra and the damning accusation that he had planned to move the capital of the Roman empire to Alexandria and be buried there with the children he had fathered by Cleopatra. In choosing Rome as the location for the Mausoleum, Augustus used the monument to advertise his full commitment to life and death in Rome itself. Augustus chose to place his Mausoleum in the northern zone of the Campus Martius, near the location where Augustus’ troops had camped during his first, illegal march on Rome in 43 BC, after having been snubbed by the senate, evoking the place where his military power had been so boldly on display.
o	In addition, in choosing the location just north of the earlier Republican tombs, Augustus was distinguishing himself from the Romans before him by not being buried in the tomb of his adoptive father, Julius Caesar, promoting his role as founder of a new era in Roman history as the “son” of Caesar, and creating his own dynastic tomb for his new dynasty, with the power and authority to reward his loyal supporters and followers, with burial in the monument and to deny others; i.e., determine who would be in his new dynasty and who would be excluded from it. The location of his mausoleum was also a nod to the traditional Roman founder of Rome and to Augustus’ role as the founder of a new Rome: for the mausoleum was located near the traditional location of the tomb of the first king of Rome, Romulus (near the Lapis Niger); in this way, Augustus evoked the oldest traditions of Rome, and by analogy with Romulus, established his status as a founding father, a pater patriae of Rome. There were other practical advantages for the location. The northern zone of the Campus Martius was relatively underdeveloped, which showcased the mausoleum as the largest monument there; in addition, its position like, the Ara Pacis near the Via Flaminia and the Tiber River, dominated all northern approaches to the city of Rome. I.e., the mausoleum would have been the first thing that travelers saw of Rome (Strabo 5.3.9); and in its location and scale it evoked the greatness of the Augustus and all whose remains were housed in it.
o	Over time, the architectural details of the Mausoleum came to reflect the policies, programs and the message that Augustus intended to preserve for the future, just like his Res Gestae. In fact, a copy of his Res Gestae was displayed over the entrance to the monument. As we have seen, this catalogue of achievements written by Augustus himself, allowed him to articulate in his own words what he promoted and carried out in his public programs through visual and architectural symbolism. It has been argued that Augustus believed his legacy would be important in ensuring the future stability and ambitions of Rome. By inscribing his words into bronze, Augustus attempted to “guarantee the perpetuity” of his monumental message. The Res Gestae conforms to the Roman tradition of funeral oratory; only in this case, Augustus found a way to deliver his own eulogy from beyond the grave.
o	The sources report that the bronze plaques inscribed with the Res Gestae, describing Augustus’ accomplishments and victories, were attached either to the flanking pillars which were part of the entrance of the Mausoleum, or they were attached to the two obelisks which were located on either side of, but not attached to the entrance. Whatever the case, the prominent display of the text of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti would have reinforced the messages implied in the iconography and design of the Mausoleum, just as the images did for the Ara Pacis of Augustus: they reinforced the social, religious and military achievements of the princeps and consolidated his legacy.
o	Other sources of the design of the Mausoleum and their Meaning: The Mausoleum was topped with a large mound of earth (or tumulus) and planted with trees. Strabo describes the building as an artificial hill covered with evergreen trees; it probably was intended to evoke several types of monumental tholos type tombs of semi-divine and historical heroes, including the tomb of Alexander the Great (in Alexandria), a ruler greatly admired by Augustus and other Roman commanders (like Pompey, Caesar). Other sources of inspiration may have been the tombs of the Greek and Trojan heroes of the Trojan War, e.g., the Tomb of Aeneas in Lavinium, from whom Augustus claimed descent. Architecturally, the plan was a design that contemporary observers, like Strabo, have associated with the burial places of ancient Bronze Age Greek heroes; the monument evoked and was influenced by the tumulus tombs in Anatolia, from the the Iliad, like the tomb of Achilles. Finally, comparisons of the exterior elevation of the Mausoleum have been made with Orientalizing and Archaic period Etruscan (tholos) tombs.
o	Perched upon the dome evoking the tumulus of a hero’s tomb was a gilded, bronze statue of Augustus. It is believed to have been at least eight meters high. The placement of such a colossal statue so far above ground level would have been unprecedented in Roman funerary practices in the early 1st c. AD . Over life size statues were typically only used for divinities, so this was an unprecedented first.
o	Nothing is known about the iconography of the statue, since it is lost-it was probably melted down for coin in late antiquity. Several reconstructions have been proposed, all speculative: a nude or nearly nude Augustus, with spear in hand, as a symbol of military victory would have been too eastern for Rome at the time of Augustus’ death; Claudius was the first emperor to appear nude in a public statue. Possibly it was a veiled image in a toga, a symbol of Augustus as Pontifex Maximus and the crusader of morals!
o	The red-granite obelisks flanking the entrance evoked Octavian’s victory in Egypt over Antony and Cleopatra in the Battles of Actium and Alexandria, and the fact that Rome had achieved dominance over Egypt.
o	Surviving architectural fragments indicate that one or more round shields were carved into the decorative frieze on the exterior of the Mausoleum. In keeping with Hellenistic custom, these shields were intended as a symbol of the military skill and heroism of Augustus. They may also have contained portraits of illustrious heroes or members of the imperial family; this type of portrait is called an imago clipeata-i.e., an image in a shield. Imago clipeata is a term used to refer to the images of ancestors and famous people displayed in round shields (Latin: clipeus). They may have evoked the wax death-masks (imagines) that the Romans kept of their ancestors in shrines in their houses and displayed at family funerals
o	The decorations on the Mausoleum also reflected other achievements of Augustus that he accumulated over time: A pair of laurel trees carved into the stone around the entrance were intended to evoke the senate’s grant of the title “Augustus” in 27 BC. These stone trees also were deliberately evocative the trees planted by Augustus outside the imperial palace on the Palatine Hill and on top of the mausoleum after he received the title.
o	Who was buried in the Mausoleum The first individual whose ashes were placed in the mausoleum was Augustus’ nephew and heir apparent Marcellus, who died in 23 BC. (Dio 53. 30.5; Verg. Aen. VI.873: Consol. ad Liv. 67); next was Agrippa his right-hand man in 12 BC (Dio 54.28.5), and Drusus, his stepson in 9 BC (Dio 55.2.3); Consol. Ad Liv.; Suet Claud 1:). The remains of the two grandsons of Augustus, who had also been designated as his heirs, Lucius (AD 2 AD) and Gaius (AD 4), were also placed here (Fasti Cupr. CIL VI.884. In AD 14 Augustus' own ashes were placed here (Dio 56.42; Tac. Ann. I. 8). In his will, Augustus had excluded his daughter Julia I and his granddaughter Julia II from burial in his mausoleum, both of whom he had banished for contravening his adultery laws.* (Suet. Aug. 101; Dio 66. 32). Next followed (AD 19) Augustus’ nephew, Germanicus whose ashes were interred here (Tac. Ann III.4; CILVI. 894). Augustus wife, Livia's ashes were placed here in AD 29 (Dio 58.2.3) and in AD 37, those of her son, the emperor Tiberius (CIL VI.885). Tiberius’ successor Caligula, whose mother Agrippina I and brothers Nero and Drusus had died, the first two in exile, the last in the Palatine prison, collected their remains and placed them in the Mausoleum (Dio 59. 3; Suet. Tib. 54). A block of marble bears an inscription in honor of Agrippina I, and once contained an urn of her cremated remains (CIL VI.886), while a block with the inscription of the elder Nero (her son not the emperor) disappeared after the 16th century. The mention of both brothers in the sources regarding who was in the Mausoleum suggests that the younger son of Agrippina I, Drusus' remains were also there. * Julia II, the daughter of Julia I and Agrippa may have been exiled by virtue of her husband’s implication in a conspiracy near the end of Augustus’ death 9 AD 14).
o	Caligula’s sister, Drusilla may have been entombed here, just as Claudius and his son, Britannicus. Tacitus’ reports (Ann.16.6) Nero's second wife Poppaea Sabina was interred in the Julian tumulus, referring to the Mausoleum of Augustus. The door of the mausoleum sprang open shortly before the death of Vespasian the Flavian emperor and successor of Nero, but as Suetonius reports (Vesp 23; Dio 66.17), he declared it did not concern him. Nerva was buried here (Epit. de Caes. 12. 12). Trajan’s ashes were placed in the chamber at the foot of his column; Hadrian built his mausoleum because the mausoleum of Augustus was full (Dio 69.23). The mausoleum had been full for some time, as is revealed in an inscription of the freedman of Trajan, who worked for an imperial procurator (CIL VI. 8686). It was only opened on one other occasion when the body of Julia Domna (the wife of Septimius Severus) was temporarily placed there (Dio 79. 24), and then transferred with her son Geta’s remains to the Antonine precinct built by Hadrian.
Chapter 9: Augustus II
9a. Augustan Military Reforms 
1)	Provinces and Provincial Administration While restoring peace and stability, and “better” social and political conditions in Rome and Italy, Augustus also turned to the task of protecting the empire from attack beyond its frontiers. He implemented a defensive and administrative system for keeping stability, honesty and “peace” in the provinces.
2)	Military Reforms Augustus undertook sweeping military reforms. He implemented a system that was consonant with his policy of a seemingly “defensive” rather than offensive foreign policy: 
a)	Reduced size of the army and reformed it for its new “defensive” role. 
b)	Established a military force to keep peace on a professional basis. 
c)	Created a system that guaranteed military loyalty to the emperor.
3)	Provincial Administration One cause of the collapse of the Republic was corruption in the provinces. Abuses and the extortion of subjects had been committed by the publicani (equestrian tax collectors). Governors had also acquired dangerously large armies, raising the threat of usurpation and rebellion. Augustus had to ensure that he alone controlled the armies, and that he alone had their loyalty so that the Principate would not be destroyed by civil wars, as had been the Republic
4)	On the one hand, for proper defense, the frontiers had to be pushed further away from Rome. However to place armies at these distant frontiers, too far from the eyes and the ears of the emperor created the risk that these armies could rebel. The solutions involved: 
a)	Establishing and controlling imperial frontiers by keeping the frontiers as short as was necessary for safety, however not too short since his army was “waging peace” 
b)	Creating a standing professional, “peace-keeping” army 
c)	Defending Gual against German incursions by constructing a network of defensive installations along the Rhine 
5)	Praetorian Cohorts/praetorian guard 
a)	Augustus developed an elite corps of soldiers called praetorian cohorts: nice infantry cohorts, each with a cavalry squadron 
b)	Headed by two prefects of equestrian rank, called Praetorian Prefects, the cohorts guarded the emperor and kept peace in Rome and Italy 
c)	They did not undertake active service unless the emperor did 
d)	The praetorians were cherished and eventually influential in the imperial court 
e)	The praetorians also had ore privileges and better pay than the legionaries 
6)	Army: Reduction of Legions After the battle of Actium there were over 60-70 legions. Augustus reduced the number to the minimum required for the defense of the empire and frontiers. By 13 BC there were up to 28 legions stationed permanently. Eventually, 25 became the standard number, and the legions became permanent units; previously militias had moved around. The legions were recruited from Roman citizens, who came from Rome, Italy and the predominantly Celtic areas north of the Po River (Cisalpine Gaul), now Romanized and enfranchised. Transalpine Gaul, now Romanized, also provided troops.
7)	Non-citizens were sometimes admitted under certain circumstances, and could receive the citizenship as a reward. Conscription was used in emergencies, but under normal circumstances, enrollment was voluntary. Many men were attracted to military careers because of the good pay and profession perks. Since this was a professional army, the prospect of promotion and advancement was real. After retirement a soldier even had the possibility of advancing socially, to the equestrian rank.  
8)	Following the system of the Republic, top officers were drawn from the senatorial and equestrian classes. A legion was commanded by a legatus of senatorial rank, called a legate. A military governor of an imperial province was also called a Legate.* The military governor had authority over the legionary legate. Military governors were ex-officio consuls and chosen by the emperor. They held their posts for no longer than two or three years. The limited duration of the tenure of Legates curbed the possibility of the Legate winning the loyalty of the legions and undermining the authority of the emperor (for the most part). *with a capital L
9)	Military Tribunes and Centurions Under the legates, who headed the legions, were the military tribunes, men of equestrian rank or newly acquired senatorial rank. They had little or no military training and were trained on site. They oversaw the administrative affairs of legionary legates, and sometimes commanded cohorts of the praetorian guard. Their lack of military skill was counterbalanced by the deployment of centurions and military engineers. Centurions were professional commanders with military experience, but little administrative authority; they were promoted based on their military skills and valor. Centurions had been around since Marius’ time; however they acquired a more favored, formal and regulated status now.
10)	Auxilium (Auxilia) an innovation of Augustus, and the second branch of the military. Auxiliaries were also under the control of the legionary legates, and were stationed permanently with the regular legions, but they were distinct from legions. Unlike the regular legions, Auxilia were recruited from non-citizens in un-Romanized areas of the western empire. They were commanded by special prefers, who were provincial tribal chiefs or Roman legionary centurions. These prefects took orders from the legates, and upon discharge they received the Roman citizenship. Sometimes freedom served in auxilia and sometimes military tribunes commanded cavalry units of auxilia. 
11)	Provincials and the Propaganda of the Pax Romana Auxilia allowed the Romans to top up defense without recruiting more citizens from Rome and Italy, where manpower had become increasingly scarce. They also allowed provincials to work with the citizenry of the army towards the mutual promotion of the Pax Romana in the provinces: Previously provincials had not been recruited for defense. Augustus was showing that he trusted them, and he needed their help to maintain peace. The arrangement also kept a lot of “war” out of the lives of the Romans and Italians.
12)	Auxilia consolidated defense, while fostering the loyalty of the provinces. The citizenship which provincial solders received upon retirement, also led to the assimilation of provincial populations into the state. The armies, both the regular legions and the local auxilia, were stationed permanently in provinces where they were most needed to guard frontiers.
13)	In peace-time, the armies built roads, canals, fortifications, and aqueducts; urbanized remote areas. The presence of regular legions had helped to spread Roman culture and the Latin language throughout provinces. Under Augusts there were conflicts in the provinces, which required some mobility of legions from front to front. 
14)	Legionaries gained efficiency through knowledge of local conditions, since they were permanently stationed in the provinces. Troops brought their knowledge and customs to outlying areas, and garrisons became centers of Romanization. One disadvantage of this arrangement is that over time soldiers turned away from Rome and became more loyal to their legions and the locals. Many legionaries intermarried with local women, because the Augustan marriage laws did not permit soldiers to marry Roman women. Augustus wanted to keep Roman women in Rome, producing Roman babies (instead of following husbands to army camps in the provinces); the law was later overturned by Septimius Severus.
15)	Navy: 
a)	Under Augustus, as in the Republic, the navy was a junior force. 
b)	Augustus created a professional, permanent navy and established server naval bases. 
c)	The two main fleets were located at Misenum (Tyrrhenian) and Arimuium (Adriatic) 
d)	The function of navy was to police the seas, guarantee grain shipments, curb piracy, transport troops & supplies, and guard coast. Crews were recruited from freeborn provincials and freedmen; ships were commanded by equestrian prefects. 
9b. Eastern frontiers and red sea
1)	II. Provincial arrangements in the East. The Failed expedition to Arabia.
2)	Frontiers: Eastern: 
a)	Roman power in the east depended on good provincial administration and the maintenance of friendly vassal kingdoms:
i)	In order to secure the loyalty of the provinces of Asia, Bithynia, Cilicia and Syria it was necessary to mandate good provincial administration. 
ii)	Loyalty and protection of vassal kingdoms as buffer states between Parthia and the Roman provinces also required keeping Roman-friendly kings on the throne. 
3)	The importance of thr eastern frontiers in demonstrated by the fact that Augustus visited this area immediately after the Battle of Actium, in 30-29 BC, and again between 22-19 BC. Eastern commands were given to Augustus’s top military commander, Vipsanius Agrippa in 23-21 BC and 16-13 BC. Parthia threatened Asia Minor, (provinces of Asia, Syria, Bithynia and Cilicia) However, the rest of the area was ruled by vassals and subject kings, Augustus re-partitioned kingdoms and provinces to ensure stability in this area
4)	20 BC Augustus sent Tiberius ( stepson and successor) out to Armenia Minor with an army. Tiberius put Tigranes III, the brother of the late Artaxias and a friend of the Roman people, on the throne. 
5)	Lesser Armenia/Armenia Minor/ Armenia Inferior: 
a)	Lesser Armenia was generally a Roman vassal/protectorate kingdom, ruled by a king chosen by Rome. Less Armenia was annexed as province for (only) a brief period of time by Trajan. Kingdom of Armenia to east was independent and generally hostile to Rome; it eventually went over to Parthians and Persians. AQ 287 Lesser Armenia and Kingdom of Armenia re-united briefly. 
b)	Tiberius expleed the Parthians from Armenia Minot, installed the new king, and recovered the Roman standards the Parthians had taken after the defeat of the Romans at Carrhae under Crassus. This act restored Rome’s dignitas in the east, although it did not resolve the Parthian problem. It was however, a public relations victory for Augustus, who promoted the recovery of the Roman standards as great military achievement. 
6)	After Parthia relinquished control of Lesser Armenia (Minor) Tiberius re-installed a Roman-friendly king, Tigranes III. It was ruled by client kings, but more or less controlled by Rome. 
7)	Augustan coins depict the handing over the standards by a personification of Armenia, kneeling at the feet of Rome, Obv: Feronia (prosperity, health) Rev: kneeling Parthian supplicatio: a supplication for mercy by a barbarian 
8)	Military defense of the east was based on Syria, to which the eastern part of Cilicia was added. Four legions were garrisoned in northern Syria for deployment to the Euphrates, Asia and Armenia. The legions were quartered near or in cities, rather than in remote camps and forests, as was the case in the western, less urbanized provinces. The proximity of soldiers to cities created disciplinary problems. The governorship of Syria was the most important, and sought-after of governorships of imperial provinces
9)	Deviating from his policy of nonaggression in the east, in 26 BC Augustus sent Aelius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt, to lead an expedition to south Arabia against the Sabaeans, who had settled near Aden, Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia.
10)	The straits of Bab-el Mandeb separate the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa. The purpose was economic: this district imported and exported frankincense, myrrh, gold and precious stones. The Sabaeans acted as commercial intermediaries between India and the Mediterranean, and the Romans wanted some control.
11)	The Red Sea Expedition was undertaken from 26-24 BC. It was badly handled by Aelius Gallus, who understood little about the topography of the area or the climate. After two years, which included an unnecessary and perilous departure by sea, and months of marching in circles through the desert, they had to turn back, never reaching their final destination of Yemen and the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb (although they got close). However, Aelius Gallus’ expedition paved the way for more successful expeditions in subsequent years. Strabo wrote later, that from the Red Sea, 125 ships sailed east every year to Zanzibar and to east Africa, and as far as western India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and “Indochina.”
12)	According to Strabo, who was a friend of Aelius Gallus, the expedition failed, as a result of the treachery of Gallus’ Nabataean (northern Arabian) guide, Syllaeus. Syllaeus claimed falsely to Gallus, that there was no safe way to get to their first destination, the city of Leuke Kome* by land and they would have to go by sea. Had Gallus checked, in fact he could have reached Leuke Kome (from Alexandria, their starting point) on land. Consequently, at Cleopatris (Suez), he built a huge fleet and set sail on a dangerous voyage with about 10,000 infantry men and got lost; the weather was bad, and many men perished. Sources: Strabo 16.4.23-24; Pliny NH 6.160; Josephus JA 15. 317; CassiusDio 53.29.3-8; Res Gestae Divi Augusti 5. 26.
13)	Strabo, as mentioned, was a friend of Gallus; and his narrative is believed to have been based on Gallus’ report; he may have used the story of the deception of Syllaeus to gloss over what appears to have been a gross miscalculation and lack of good military intelligence and judgment by Gallus. When they reached Leuke Kome, Gallus and his men were so weak that they had to stay there for several months from Aug/Sept of 26 BC to March/April of 25 BC; many more men perished and suffered from scurvy and hunger. Then they wandered for another six months needlessly, and lost several more men to starvation and disease until they realized that they had been tricked. Subsequently, Gallus turned his army around, and they took “only” 60 days to reach the Red Sea, which they crossed (to Myos Hormos), continuing north to Alexandria with nothing to show for their trouble.
14)	Archaeological Sites at Pondicherry Territory and Arikamedu have yielded evidence of trade in the form of Roman material cultural remains. Augustus received two embassies from India. 
15)	This map is based on a mid 1st c AD periplus of the Erythraean Sea: The periplus was an itinerary of navigation with trade routes and ports along the coast of the Red Sea, Northeast Africa and India. The periplus demonstrates that by AD 50, there were established trade routes used by the Romans. Periplus: a manuscript document (map, and itinerary) that lists trade routes, ports and coastal landmarks in order, with the approximate intervening distances that a vessel could expect to find along the shore.
9c. Egypt and North Africa 
1)	Augustus annexed Egypt in 30 BC as an imperial province
2)	Prefects of Egypt under Augusts: 
a)	Corenlius Gallus 30-26 BC
b)	Aelius Gallus 26-24 BC
c)	Gaius Petronius 24-20 BC
3)	Egypt was the richest province. It produced one third of the imperial grain supply. Egypt was administered by a prefect [of equestrian rank] who commanded a legionary army (usually of two legions). No one was allowed to enter Egypt without the permission of the emperor.
4)	Cornelius Gallus, as prefect led an expedition against the Ethiopians 28 BC. However, he was dismissed, and punished because he overstepped the limits of power allowed by his position 
5)	The downfall of Cornelius Gallus
a)	Augustus’ position in Egypt was unique: As the successor of the Ptolemies, Augustus was regarded in Egypt as an absolute monarch. His prefect was seen as viceroy and given royal honors. The royal treatment given to Roman administrators by the Egyptians made the prefecture attractive to aspiring rulers, like Cornelius Galllus. He commissioned status of himself, and had inscriptions hailing his exploits, inscribed on pyramids. Finally recalled to Rome and convicted of treason, he was condemned to death, and allowed to take his own life. 
6)	Gaius Petronius: the campaigns of Cornelius Gallus were continued by the prefect G. Petronius in campagns of 22 BC. Petronius pushed the Ethiopians down into the Sudan. He also fixed the southern boundary of Egypt near the First Cataract, where it remained for 300 years. 
7)	Africa was the other important source of grain. Its defense was important, Although it was a senatorial peocince, it was garrisoned: the 3rd Legion was stationed there. Under Augustus, Carthage was restored, urbanized and promoted as the capital city of Africa Proconsularis. Urbanization was focused on Carthaginian (Punic) port cities in order to restore trade and commercial routes. The province was peaceful, however the western frontiers needed protection. 3rd Legion was periodically moved d\further west as need dictated. 
8)	Protean (ever-changing) Africa In 45 BC Caesar enlarged the original province of Africa with the annexation of eastern Numidia ( Africa Nova). The original province was renamed Africa Vetus (old Africa) to distinguish it from Caesar's Africa Nova. Between 44 BC and 42 BC Africa Nova and Africa Vetus existed side by side. In 42 BC Octavian made the two Africas one province.
9)	In 27 BC Augustus relinquished some of Africa Nova on west and extended the province to the east (coastal Tripolitania) to promote trade with the east (and restoring Punic ports on the coast). Augustus renamed the new province Africa Proconsularis, because although garrisoned (3rd Legion), it was a senatorial province, governed by a proconsul.
10)	Augustus believed the combined area of Africa Vetus, Africa Nova and Tripolitania was too vast to defend. Consequently, he allowed areas to the (wilder) west (i.e., Nova) to revert to, or remain as protectorates or vassal kingdoms.
11)	In 25 BC Augustus gave the kingdom of Mauretania to Juba II, the son of Juba I (Caesar’s enemy); its capital was Iol, also known as a Caesarea by the Romans. *Augustus may have briefly restored the Numidian kingdom of Juba I (Cirta) to Juba II, earlier, in 31 BC (when he was known as Octavian), although this is not certain.
12)	Juba I (left) had been an enemy of Julius Caesar (6d): he had fought for Pompey (in Africa at Bagradas and Thapsus). Caesar punished Juba I by taking his kingdom of eastern Numidia from him, and making it Africa Nova; Juba II (right), his son, was raised in Rome as a pignus (a pledge or hostage); a pignus was normally a family member (usually a child) taken by Rome, to incentivize compliance with Roman treaty requirements; Juba II became a friend of Rome.
13)	In 25 BC Augustus appointed Juba II, the son of Juba I, as client king of Mauretania and western Numidia, and allocated parts of the Gaetulian kingdom to him. Juba II was to rule Mauretania (the Mauri tribes) and western Numidia (the Masaesyle tribes) from the city named Iol (by the Phoenicians; Caesarea by the Romans). When Juba I was defeated by Caesar in 46 BC; his infant son Juba II was taken to Rome and raised in the household of Caesar with Caesar’s heir Octavian; in ca. 20 BC, Octavian, now known as Augustus, married him to the daughter of Cleopatra and Antony, Cleopatra Selene (Dio 51.15.6)
14)	The children of Antony and Cleopatra were taken to Rome, as pledges, ( pignora), and raised in the imperial court; Juba II married Cleopatra Selene their daughter (pictured above). Juba II assisted Augustus in the foundation of 12 new colonies along the Moroccan coast, the most famous being Volubilis and Tangiers, where purple dye was made.
15)	Augustan urbanization of Africa Proconsularis and Carthage: Augustus completed what Caesar had started, now with an imperial bureaucracy. Augusts settled 3000 colonists around Carthage. He practices a policy of clemency and generous patronage to Phoenician and Carthaginain towns. He also revived the old Punic cults and completed what Caesar had started: he restored Carthage, and made it into a beautiful town. 
16)	Appian 28. 136: ‘But Julius Caeaser was assassinated shortly afterward by his enemies in the Roman Senate, and his son Augustus, finding this memorandum, built the present Carthage, not on the site of the old one, but very near it, in order to avoid the ancient curse. I have ascertained that he sent some 3000 colconists from Rome and that the rest came from the neighboring country. And thus Romans took Africa away from the Carthaginians, destroyed Carthage, and re-peopled it again 102 years after its destruction.” Dio 52. 43: Caesar (=Augustus) also settled Carthage anew, because Lepidus had laid waste a part of it, and by this act, it was held, (Lepidus) had abrogated the rights of the earlier colonists. 
17)	 Augustus Focused on Phoenician and Carthaginian Towns.Augustan policy was aimed at reviving the original commercial networks that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians had established before the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. Augustus also sponsored Phoenician colonization in other areas of Proconsularis, and granted municipal autonomy to Phoenician towns. Augustus even allowed towns to mint their own coinage in order to promote trade and business.
18)	The principles of Augustan imperialism in Africa were flexible, if not consistent (i.e. generous but somewhat arbitrary).He promoted security and cooperation at commercial ports by allowing autonomy in municipal government and in terms of cultural norms ( System of Alliances and Pax Romana).This policy was feasible because these towns had long been urbanized by the Phoenicians.In addition, Phoenician cities were allowed to maintain their Carthaginian forms of government.
a)	Pliny's list of Augustan colonies shows that urbanization and colonization increased under Augustus.
b)	The annals for the 30's and 20's corroborate Pliny: they document foundations in Africa.
19)	Promotion of Carthage:
a)	Within a few years the municipium* of Carthage was upgraded to a free colonia with special status (the citizenship and no tax).
b)	Carthage became the capital of Africa Proconsularis; the original captal of the first province in 146 BC had been Utica.
c)	The province was governed by a Proconsul, a senatorial man chosen by the senate;
d)	 Augustus continued to enlarge the city limits by settling veterans in the suburbs; over the next centuries Carthage became one of most important cities in the Roman Empire.
20)	In sum, Augustan principles of development were consistent with the ideals of the Pax Romana because they promoted:
a)	Political alliances with native populations.
b)	The strategic settlement of veterans.
c)	 Economic and social policies of Romanization, including grants of citizenship to provincials and freedmen.
d)	This policy laid the foundation for more massive and broad-scoped urbanization in the second century AD.
e)	Africa had a special provincial status: it was Senatorial, but it also had one permanent Legion (3rd) to protect its assets.
Augustus saw the necessity of protecting this valued territory
21)	Carthage and other coastal Punic towns were re-established as trading centers; they were developed, expanmded, and they received grants of autonomy. Centuriation and Roads under Augustus: Gromatic (surveyors') stones in Southern Tunisia have been left in position by Roman surveyors. From these reference points archaeologists have been able to reconstruct the main lines of a map of Africa Proconsularis believed to have been drawn up by the 3rd legion during the reign of Augustus. The first strategic roads were also built by the 3rd Legion in the Augustan period.They were correlated with the centuriation.
22)	Centuriation is a method of land measurement used by the Romans, and based on systems developed in Egypt, Etruria and Greece. Centuriation is characterized by the use of a square grid plan traced by surveyors. Gridded plots of land were allocated to Roman veterans, citizens and Latin colonists, and to indigenous towns and populations in North Africa. Although Caesar began the process of urbanizing North Africa, attempts were made as early as the Jugurthine War and the Gracchan tribunates in the late 2nd c. BC. It is, however, Augustus who developed a sustained policy of urbanization in North Africa, creating a blue-print that was followed by his successors, the Julio-Claudians.
23)	Surveryors use a method of trangularion: they trace and measure a series of triangles to determine the distances and relative positions of points sprad over a territory or region. The north/south orientation of the centuriation was based on the sun. 
9d. Spain and Gaul 
1)	After campaigning in Spain, early in the reign, Augustus repartitioned it into three provinces. The indigenous tribes in northwest Spain continued to threaten Romanization. In 26 BC Augustus and Agrippa had gone to Spain to subdue the Cantabrians (a fierce probably pre-Celtic tribe in the north). As we have seen,*Augustus was forced to withdrew because he fell ill; Agrippa suppressed the revolts and won the war in 19 BC. The stabilization of Spain allowed the number of permanent garrisons to be reset at three legions, stationed in the north and in the west.
2)	19 BC
a)	Father Spain: was divided into two provinces now
i)	Baetica in the south became a senatorial province
ii)	Lusitania in the wilder west became an imperial province
b)	Nearer Spain was not partitioned; just renamed Tarraconensis and made an imperial province. 
3)	Gaul 12 BC Gaul was conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BC however, it was not completely pacified until 12 BC.
4)	Gallia Narbonensis 12 BC: Augustus' mandate was to organize what Caesar had subdued, so that the less Romanized territory of Outer Gaul could be efficiently administered and urbanized.Gallia Transalpina, which had been annexed in 121 BC was made a senatorial province, and renamed Gallia Narbonensis.
5)	The rest of Gaul was divided into three provinces: Aquitania, Lugdunensis and Belgica. They were governed by one military governor (Legate), headquartered at Lugdunum [Lyon]. In addition, a subordinate legate (head of a legion) was posted in each province.
6)	In 12 BC Gallia Transalpina was renamed Gallia Narbonensis and made a senatorial province. The three outer Gauls were named Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Lugdunensis and Gallia Belgica; they were made imperial provinces and governed by legionary legates, under the authority of one Military Governor (Legate) headquartered at Lugdunum in Gallia Lugdunensis).
7)	In 28 BC Augustus went out to Gaul to take the census and assess taxes and tributes. During this time, Agrippa built a road system which was centered at Lugdunum (Lyon). Lyon was at the juncture of the Rhone and Saone Rivers, and it became an important commercial and cultural center. For the defense of Gaul eight legions were stationed along the Rhine to guard the eastern frontier. Gaul’s greatest threat came from the east, from the German tribes to the east of the Rhine.
8)	The Cult of Augustus and Roma was celebrated in Gaul.
a)	This coin was struck in Gaul between 9 and 14 AD by a Romanized Gaul. The obverse depicts Augustus with the legend Caesar Augustus, Son of God, Father of the Country. The reverse depicts the Altar of Lugdunum which commemorated the provincial Cult of Roma (goddess of Rome) and Augustus; the legend is ROM ET AVG (for the cult of Roma and Augustus). 
b)	The Cult of Roma and Augustus was a bit more “ruler cultish” than the Cult of the Genius of Augustus, and thus would not have been appropriate to observe in Rome.
9e. Northeastern frontiers
1)	Caesar had established the Rhine as a defense border, and had taken extreme measures (e. g., massacres of women and children) to keep the German tribes from crossing the Rhine over to Gaul. Augustus aspired to invade more areas to the east of the Rhine in what the Romans called Germania Magna, but as we will see, he would fail to realize this enterprise, after the defeat of the Romans by Arminius in what came to be known as the Varian Disaster (presentation 9g). Consequently, after this crisis Augustus established two militarized zones, Upper and Lower Germania, on the west bank of the Rhine; they were governed by legionary legates, who were under the authority of the legionary legate of (Gallia) Belgica.* These military zones were not annexed as bona fide provinces until the time of the emperor Domitian (AD 81-96), and Rome never acquired provinces (or sovereignty) in Germania Magna to the east of Rhine. *The legionary legate of Belgica was, in turn, subordinate to the Military Governor (Legate) of Lugdunensis.
2)	Augustus laid plans to invade Germany and to push the frontier of the Roman empire as far east as the Elbe, and eventually the Vistula. The propaganda: Pax Romana Reality: imperial dominionThis would not only have enhanced the security of the Gauls, but also would shorten the boundaries, requiring less manpower to defend them.
3)	Augustus assigned the invasion of Germany to his stepsons, Drusus and Tiberius. Tiberius was to advance from Gallia Narbonensis. Drusus was to lead maneuvers north from Cisalpine Gaul. The campaign was perilous and difficult because the Romans did not understand the topography; there were no roads, and the forests were dark, dense and swampy.
4)	Drusus (Nero Claudius) Drusus built a canal called the fossa Drusiana, linking the bay (Zuider Zee) at the opening of the North Sea (in Holland) with the Rhine; access to this waterway allowed him to build and provision forts on the Rhine efficiently, using the river to transport material on barges, rather than journeying on land through the dense forests of the Gallic provinces. As military legate in Gaul from 12 BC to 9 BC Drusus conducted many successful campaigns in Germania Magna on the east side of the Rhine; in the process he temporarily brought the region between the Rhine and the Elbe under Roman rule. En route to Mainz from the Elbe, he died of a leg wound resulting from a fall in 9 BC. Buried in Mausoleum Augusti (in Rome 8e), he was mourned and honored as a favorite of the people and army to succeed to Augustus (Tac. Ann. 2, 41; 6, 5; Suet. Claud. 1, 5).
5)	The victoties of Tiberius and Drusus were commemorated by Horace. A monumental trophy to the emperor, naming the forty-six Alpine and Rhaetian tribes they had subjugated, was set up at la Turbie. 
6)	The trophy was set up on the occasion of the conquest of the Ligurians in the Maritime Alps (southwestern Alps in southeastern France). However, it also commemorated all conquests on the Rhine.
7)	15 BC from mint of Lyon London, British Museum; Tiberius and Drusus hand Augustus symbols of victory after their campaigns of 16/15 BC. Augustus sits on sella curulis. 
8)	Following Drusus death, in 6 BC Tiberius was mandated to resume campaigns in Gaul; he had been deployed to the Danube, because Agrippa, who had previously commanded there, had died in 12 BC . Consequently, Tiberius spent the years between 12 BC and AD 6 (while he was fighting a war on the northern border of the Balkans) dividing his time between the Rhine, and the Danubian provinces (see presentation 9f). In sum, Tiberius’ successful campaigns in eastern Gaul enabled Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus to cross the Rhine, march to the Elbe River, and negotiate the position of Rome with the local German tribes; in addition, he oversaw the settlement of 40,000 pacified Germans in eastern Gaul on the Roman controlled (western) bank of the Rhine.  
9f. Danubian provinces revolt of bato
1)	Tiberius campaigned in the Illyrian and Danubian provinces, after Agrippa, who had been mandated to campaign there, died in 12 BC. Consequently, between 12 BC and AD 6, when he was campaigning full-time to suppress the Great Illyrian Revolt, Tiberius was dividing his time between the Rhine and the Danube.
2)	Rome had gained control of the territory up to the Danube, and as far to the east as Vienna. The Alps, Guals and Spain were pacified. Augustus planned to neutralize the northern boundary of the Balkans, and the areas to the south of the Danube. 
3)	Earlier campagins had resulted in the pacification of the indigenous tribes who had settled in Siscia. When these tribes started to make trouble in 13 BC, Augustus laubched an aggressive in the area. 
4)	In 27 BC Augustus had annexed this area as the senatorial province of Illyricum ( which corresoinds roughly to western Serbia, central Croatia northern Bosnia and Albania). 
5)	Agrippa had been mandated to campaign in Illyricum, and northeast in Pannonia; however ,when he died in 12 BC, Tiberius took over his campaigns. The province of Pannonia includes Slovenia, northeastern Croatia, Hungary, eastern Austria, and northwestern Serbia. In 12 BC Pannonia was also added to Illyricum, which had in the meantime become an imperial province.
6)	Tiberius campaigned in of Illyricum and Poannoia; then he returned to the Rhine in 6 BC to resume campaigns to the east of the Rhine in Germania Magna. 
7)	Tweleve years later in AD 6 Tiberius was called back to Pannonia when a serious revolt erupted; it had been organized by a coalition of Dalmatian and Pannonian tribes. 
8)	The revolt is known as the Great Illyrian Revolt, The Dalmatian-Pannonian Revolt, or the Bellum Batonianum, named after the leader of the revolt, Bato. It lasted from AD 6 to AD 9)
9)	In fact, the Dalmatian and Pannonian tribes staged an uprising led by two chief-tains, both named Bato. The Bato, who is pictured at the right was the preeminent, most important leader. He was a Dalmatian chief of the tribe of the Daesidiates. The sources report that the rebels massacred Roman and Italian residents in the area of Moesia.
10)	Caecina Severus, the legate of Moesia (to the east, annexed just before AD 6), stepped in and held Sirmium until Tiberius arrived to take the offensive, and he defeated the Pannonians in two campaigns of AD 7 and 8
11)	Dio (55, 29-34; 56, 11-26) and Velleius Paterculus (2, 110-16) attribute the cause of the war to the corrupt tax policies and recruitment practices of Roman governors and military (legionary) legates, respectively. After his first successes, Bato gained the support of the Breuci (under the other, less important chief, Bato). After they were initially defeated by Messalla Messalinus, both Batos attacked the Romans in AD 7 from the Mons Alma (a mountain in Fruska Gora in northern Serbia). Tiberius was finally able to overcome the rebels, who were weakened by hunger and disease in AD 8, with the help of Caecina Severus, the Legate of Moesia, and Plautius Silvanus, his legionary commander. After he had pacified Pannonia, Tiberius pursued Bato, (the Dalmatian chief of the Daesidiates), until he was forced to surrender in AD 9, with his followers in the Roman mountain fort of Andetrium ( Gornje Muc, near Zagreb, Croatia). Bato was displayed in Tiberius’ triumphal procession (Suet. Tib. 20) and sent into exile on the coast of the Black Sea (Ovid Pont. 2, 1, 45).
12)	By AD 9 the revolt was crushed. i. AD 9 Pannonia was annexed as an imperial province. The history of the partitioning and status of the provinces in this area is complicated and fluid:* In 12 BC Pannonia (previously senatorial) had been added to Illyricum; then Illyricum was armed and made imperial. Previously, in 27/26 BC Illyricum had been senatorial. ii. In AD 9 Illyricum was also renamed Dalmatia. iii. AD 6 Moesia (previously senatorial) armed, was made imperial.
13)	In sum, the Illyrian Revolt resulted in the (final) annexation of: 
a)	AD 6 Moesia (imperial) 
b)	AD 9 Pannonia (imperial) 
c)	AD 9 Dalmatia (imperial) 
d)	The suppression of the Illyrian Revolt completed Roman expansion in central Europe and settled the frontier north of the Balkans. It also brought destruction and devastation to the Danubian provinces and tribal populations in the area.
9g. Varian Disaster 
Meanwhile back in Germany, in AD 9, news came of the overwhelming defeat of the Roman forces in Germany. This event is known as the Varian Disaster: Clades Variana
1)	The Rhine frontier had remained quiet after the campaigns of Drusus and Tiberiu. Roman armies had over-run the country from the Rhine to Elbe. However, conquest had not yet been consolidated by:
a.	construction of permanent forts or roads.
b.	regular patrolling and administration.
c.	urbanization and taxation of the area.
2)	It is important to keep in mind that the Romans had controlled Germania Magna between the Rhine and the Elbe since 9 BC, thanks to Drusus’ campaigns.
3)	Sources: Tacitus I. 60-62 Florus Epitome of History II. 30. 31-39 Cassius Dio 56. 18-23 Velleius Paterculus II. 117-120 (contemporary account). These narratives are informed by the change in policy in Germania Magna, after the Varian disaster. They are biased against Varus’ aggressive policy: i. e., the Romans campaigned aggressively on the east side of the Rhine (Germania Magna) but abandoned this policy after the Varian disaster, so in hindsight, accounts are critical because of the bad outcome.
4)	 Arminius: A huge triubal revolt in the area east of the Rhine was organized by Arminius, the chief of the Gernman Cherusci tribe, and a former auxiliary, who had attained the Roman citizebship, and the rank of Equestrian.
5)	Varus and Arminius: 
a.	The opportunity for a major revolt was occasioned by the arrival of the Roman commander: Quintilius Varus
b.	Varus, former Legate (military governor) of Syria, is portrayed in the sources as a reckless and feckless general.  
6)	AD 7 Varus was sent out to Germany as legate (commander of the army of Germania Inferior-militarized zone) to organize areas east of the Rhine, to tax populations and establish Roman control. Varus marched with his legions through the German region between the Rhine and the Elbe, acting as Roman representative 
7)	Germania Inferior and Germania Superior were created in 16 and 13 BC (respectively) as military zones in the province of Gallia Belgica. The commanders of the armies of the Lower Rhine (Inferior) and Middle Rhine (Superior) were subordinate to the legionary legate of Belgica who was in turn, subordinate to the one Military Governor (Legate) of the 3 Gauls (Lugdunensis, Aquitania and Belgica), based at Lugdunum. But in practice, the military zones were autonomous. The complicated command chain of these regions was recognized by Domitian, who upgraded them to provinces in AD 84 or 85.
8)	Varus is accused of having misjudged the conditions of his command: For Varus treated Germania Magna like a province, raising the tribute, holding court, and committing other abuses, like cruel methods of taxation and the enforcement of jurisdiction, all of which provoked the Germans to rise up against Roman rule. However, there were no hostilities at that time with the German tribes in the western-most strip of Germania Magna, on the right (east) bank of the Rhine. That small westernmost part of the east bank had been in Roman hands since 9/7 BC, and it was already developing a settled, urban character. I.e., arguably it was not inappropriate that Varus should advance the development of a province in Germania Magna; the sources are biased against Varus because his tenure resulted in defeat, and massive loss of life.
9)	 Varus also unsuspectingly entertained Arminius in his (Arminius’ camp) on the Weser (Virsurgis) River, midway between the Rhine and the Elbe and next to the Teutoburg Forest; however, Arminius’ friendship was a ruse to trick Varus into trusting the Germans. According to Dio, Arminius had found out when, and by what routes Varus would be withdrawing his troops to their winter quarters: through the Teutoburg Forest, immediately to the west, (on the east side of the Rhine). Dio 56 18 4-5. 4. “Now they did not openly revolt, since they saw that there were many Roman troops near the Rhine and many within their own borders. 5. Instead, they received Varus, and pretended that they would do all he demanded of them, and thus, they drew him far away from the Rhine into the land of the Cherusci, toward the Visurgis, and there, by behaving in a most peaceful and friendly manner, they led him to believe that they would live submissively without the presence of soldiers.”
10)	Dio 56. 19 1-5 1. “Consequently he did not keep his legions together, as was proper in a hostile country, but distributed many of the soldiers to helpless communities, which asked for them for the alleged purpose of guarding various points, arresting robbers, or escorting provision trains. 2. Among those deepest in the conspiracy and leaders of the plot and of the war were Arminius and Segimerus, who were his constant companions and often shared his mess. 3. He accordingly became confident, and expecting no harm, not only refused to believe all those who suspected what was going on and advised him to be on his guard, but actually rebuked them for being needlessly excited and slandering his friends. Then there came an uprising, first on the part of those who lived at a distance from him, deliberately so arranged, 4. in order that Varus should march against them and so be more easily overpowered while proceeding through what was supposed to be friendly country, instead of putting himself on his guard as he would do in case all became hostile to him at once. And so, it came to pass. They escorted him as he set out, and then begged to be excused from further attendance, in order, as they claimed, to assemble their allied forces, after which they would quietly come to his aid. 5. Then they took charge of their troops, which were already in waiting somewhere, and after the men in each community had put to death the detachments of soldiers for which they had previously asked, they came upon Varus in the midst of forests by this time almost impenetrable. And there, at the very moment of revealing themselves as enemies instead of subjects, they wrought great and dire havoc.”
11)	In AD 9, Varus was ambushed by a confederation of German tribes (the Cherusci, Marsi , Bructeri, Chatti) under the leadership of Arminius. Varus had allowed himself to be lured into impassable territory, the Teutoberg Forest, where his army did not have sufficient opportunities of deployment (the baggage train and the rain added to his difficulties). Three legions and many auxiliary troops were destroyed in battles that extended over several days. Varus himself committed suicide and fell on his sword, as did many of his officers.
12)	As Varus and his legions were marching though the dense Teutoberg forest they were attacked by Arminius: Teutoberg Forest near Bremmen east side Rhine. 
13)	Varus’ three Roman legions were virtually destroyed and Varus committed sucide. 20000 of his men were killed or committed suicide; many were tortured and executed. Some survived to tell the story. Tacitus cities eye witness-accounts: there was a storm, and Romans were lost, panic stricken, and unable to fight a relentless enemy
14)	Florus Epitome of History II. 30.29-39. 
a.	“But it is more difficult to retain than to create provinces; they are won by force, but they are secured by justice. 
b.	Therefore our joy was short-lived; for the Germans had been defeated rather than subdued, and under the rule of Drusus, they respected our moral qualities rather than our arms. 
c.	After Drusus death (9 BC) they began to detest the licentiousness, pride and cruelty of Varus. He had the temerity to hold an assembly, and issued an edict against the Catthi, just as though he could restrain the violence of barbarians by the rod of a lictor and the proclamation of a herald. 
d.	But the Germans who had long been regretting that their swords were rusted, and their horses idle, as soon as they saw the toga and experienced laws crueler than arms, snatched up their weapons under the leadership of Arminius. 
e.	Meanwhile Varus was so confident of peace that he was quite unperturbed even when the conspiracy was betrayed to him by Segestes, one of the chiefs. 
f.	And so when he was unprepared and had no fear of any such thing, at a moment when (such was his confidence) he was actually summoning them to appear before his tribunal, they rose and attacked him from all sides. His camp was seized, and three legions were overwhelmed.” 
g.	“Varus met disaster by the same fate and with the same courage as Paulus on the fatal day of Cannae . 
h.	Never was there a slaughter crueler than took place there in the marshes and woods, never were more intolerable insults inflicted by barbarians, especially those directed against the legal pleaders.
i.	They put out the eyes of some of them, and cut off the hands of others; they sewed up the mouth of one of them after first cutting out his tongue, exclaiming, “At last, you viper, you have ceased to hiss.” 
j.	The body too of the consul himself, which the dutiful affection of the soldiers had buried, was disinterred. As for the standards and eagles, the barbarians possess two to this day; the third eagle was wrenched from its pole, before it could fall into the hands of the enemy, by the standard bearer, who, carrying it concealed in the folds around his belt, secreted himself in the bloodstained marsh. The result of this disaster was that the empire, which had not stopped on the shores of the Ocean,
k.	was checked on the banks of the Rhine.”
15)	Tiberius rushed to site of the disaster, but by then Rome had lost control of the area between the Rhine and the Elbe. After the battle in the Teutoburg Forest, Tiberius led punitive campaigns, but he understood that the country beyond the Rhine could not be re-occupied, and so eventually he stopped the war. Late in AD 14, Germanicus, Tiberius’ nephew, resumed the offensive, which provoked a reaction from Arminius, who was able to unite more tribes, forcing Germanicus to invade Germania again. Tacitus (I. 60-62) presents Germanicus’ army as following in the footsteps of Varus. With eight legions Tiberius and Germanicus successfully reorganized the defense of the Rhine and conducted reprisals beyond it.
16)	Tacitus I. 61: Germanicus discovers the horrific sight of the remains of Varus’ men “Germanicus upon this was seized with an eager longing to pay the last honor to those soldiers and their general, while the whole army present was moved to compassion by the thought of their kinsfolk and friends, and, indeed, of the calamities of wars and the lot of mankind. Having sent on Caecina in advance to reconnoiter the obscure forest-passes, and to raise bridges and causeways over swamps and treacherous plains, they visited the mournful scenes, with their horrible sights and associations. Varus' first camp with its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly indicated the handiwork of three legions. Further on, the partially fallen rampart and the shallow fosse suggested the inference that it was a shattered remnant of the army which had there taken up a position. In the center of the field were the whitening bones of men, as they had fled, or stood their ground, strewn everywhere or piled in heaps. Nearby lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses, and also human heads, prominently nailed to trunks of trees. In the adjacent groves were the barbarous altars, on which they had immolated tribunes and first-rank centurions. Some survivors of the disaster who had escaped from the battle or from captivity, described how this was the spot where the officers fell, how yonder the eagles were captured, where Varus was pierced by his first wound, where too by the stroke of his own ill-starred hand he found for himself death. They pointed out too, the raised ground from which Arminius had harangued his army, the number of gibbets (execution devices) for the captives, the pits for the living, and how in his exultation he insulted the standards and eagles.”
17)	Tacitus Ann. I. 59: Tacitus reports the capture of Thusnelda, the wife of Arminius and the daughter of Segestes. Segestes gave her to Germanicus, while she was pregnant with Arminius’ child. “The report of Segestes’ surrender and his gracious reception, once it became generally known, was heard with hope or sorrow by the advocates or opponents of war. Arminius, violent enough by nature, was driven frantic by the seizure of his wife and the subjugation to slavery, of her unborn child.”
18)	The lost ground and the lost legions were never recovered by Augustus (who was old and shaken by incident). Each year Augustus mourned the anniversary of the loss of the legions with these words: (Suet. Aug. 23. 2) “Varus give me back my legions.” The loss resulted in the diminution of military manpower and the recession of fortified limites (frontiers); the moral effects were severe on the Romans. The Germans destroyed Roman fortifications in the aftermath; only the area along the west bank of the Rhine remained as the military zones of upper and lower Germany; four legions were stationed in each part. The governor of Gallia Belgica oversaw the civil administration.
19)	In sum, except for the Varian disaster, Augustus achieved success on the Rhine and in the Danube. The Danubian provinces were protected by seven legions. Eight legions were stationed further northwest in Upper and Lower Germania, a military zone. Four legions were garrisoned in Syria, two in Egypt, one in Africa and three in Spain. The pattern was fossilized, in the sense that little change was made to the arrangement for a few hundred years. Newly annexed Danubian provinces were less valuable to Rome than Gaul economically because they were still wild and un-Romanized; however they would prove to be the best recruiting grounds for the Roman military in the empire.
9h. Judaea Provincial admin summary 
1)	Judaea was one of the smallest Roman provinces in the east, but it was important because its population was Jewish. The reputation of Jerusalem and the welfare of the Jewish people in Judaea was important to the Romans, because it had ramifications for those who lived in the cities with Jewish populations, in both the eastern and western Roman empire.
2)	In AD 6 Judaea was annexed by Augustus; it was governed by a prefect with less than a legion: a variable number of cohorts. In AD 41 Claudius restored Judaea to Herod Agrippa I, of the Herodian Dynasty, who reigned as a client king (12f).* In AD 44 upon the death of Herod Agrippa I, Claudius re-annexed Judaea as a province; Herod Agrippa II (son of Herod Agrippa I) was made a titular king.** However, from now on, Judaea was governed by a procurator, who was essentially an administrator with less military authority than a prefect. Consequently, the weakened authority of Rome mandated by Claudius, in the area, compromised governance, which became more arbitrary and despotic, eventually leading to a serious uprising in Judaea and a war with Rome.
3)	Augustus’ Provincial Administration Summary The provinces fall into two main groups, senatorial and imperial, unarmed and armed. Senatorial provinces were governed by proconsuls of consular or (sometimes) praetorian standing; called a proconsul. Imperial provinces were governed by ex-consuls, (sometimes) ex-praetors called a Legate (as a military governor).* Exceptions: Africa Proconsularis: senatorial armed with Third Legion Egypt: Imperial with a military governor of equestrian rank, called a prefect.
4)	The employment of equestrians as prefects and procurators broke with Republican tradition. Equestrian officials were concerned with the civil side of administration and military matters (and were often highly ranked). They also commanded the auxilia, the navy and the province of Egypt. As in domestic affairs, so in foreign policy: Augustus built up an efficient body of salaried professional administrators of equestrian rank. The advancement of equestrians depended on their loyalty, efficiency and on the emperor’s favorable patronage.
5)	Taxation of Provinces 
a.	In the field of provincial taxation Augustus made lasting contributions. Provinces were taxed, and thus provided a large proportion of revenues to the Roman state. To discourage extortion, and secure the fairer distribution of taxes, Augustus undertook the census in all provinces and established the assets and resources of the provinces and their inhabitants. Augustus started the process of weaning the administration of taxation in the provinces, from the hated publicani; taxes were administered by procurators, nonmilitary agents in the civil bureaucracy, who worked on behalf of the imperial court.
6)	Edicts of Cyrene 
a.	The Edicts of Cyrene, preserved in a Greek inscription from Cyrene reveal information about how provincials were tried in the courts, assessed and taxed; they also document the use by Augustus, of his imperium maius in the provinces, in his authority to impose the law. Direct taxes were levied on all occupants of land, whether they were owners or renters; other taxes were levied on other forms of property. Almost all provincials, including Roman citizens in the provinces, had to pay a land tax to the Roman treasury (fiscus); only certain towns were exempt: e.g., most towns of colonial status (called coloniae) in the provinces, and all towns in Italy. The revenues from provincial estates that had become the emperor’s property, either through bequests or through confiscations, were paid to his estate (patrimonium) and managed by procurators.
7)	Accountability to Provincials and Governors Besides improved financial administration and supervision, the provinces gained other advantages. The emperor paid greater attention to the appointment of governors. Governors were salaried professionals whose prospects for advancement and promotion depended on their fairness, honesty and efficiency. There was still corruption,* but retribution was swifter and harsher. *The imperial bureaucracy still relied, in part, on the publicans.
8)	Improved communication between Rome and the Provinces: Imperial staff read petitions from the provinces, and composed rescripts (directives) on behalf of the home office. Rescript: an official reply, written by the emperor (having consulted with his jurists or lawyers) to an appeal for guidance, especially on a legal point. For the sake of communication and globalization, Augustus also created an imperial postal system and directed his peacekeeping armies to build better roads. Because the emperor was (theoretically) in closer contact with the provinces, he could supervise and discipline governors and other provincial officials.
9)	Concilium 
a.	A special provincial council, called a concilium, maintained a system of checks and balances on governors. The members of the concilium met annually to discuss and evaluate the administration of their province. The concilium was also responsible for the upkeep of imperial cults in the provinces. These councils were authorized to approach the emperor or the senate directly (with petitions), without the intervention of the governor, if necessary. Concilia could even initiate prosecutions of corrupt governors.
10)	Concilium versus consilium (for which see slide 8c,1); both were created by Augustus and continued under his successors. 
a.	A concilium is a provincial town council, authorized to evaluate the deeds and mandates of a Roman governor. The concilium could communicate with the emperor and the senate by means of written petitions or in person (by sending a delegation). 
b.	A consilium is a deliberative body* of jurists and magistrates that formulated law. It provided advice to the emperor (counsel) on policy and governance; it was the prototype of the cabinet. So, remember for the test: the proto-cabinet is the consilium (with an s); the provincial town council is concilium (with a c) *(in English we can also use the term council so it’s confusing!)
11)	Augustan policies also reflect the continuation of Caesarian policies of enfranchisement and globalization: Augustus continued Caesar’s global application of the system of alliances* in the service of the Pax Romana. The imperial court encouraged city life and civic pride in provincial towns, by organizing local magistracies and councils. It also encouraged Romanized government and urbanization, where feasible, to make towns centers of Romanization. Finally, Augustus took care to help any willing provincial towns appropriate (adopt, acquire) Roman(Augustan) values and norms.
12)	As towns became more civilized, urbanized and Romanized, they became eligible for special privileges and perks from the Roman state. A system of incentives allowed provincial subjects to join in the effort to maintain the Pax Romana. Roman culture was also disseminated in provinces by means of colonies of veterans of the Roman army and the auxilia, which helped protect the Pax Romana. Auxiliaries were also enfranchised upon discharge and could even potentially attain equestrian status. The legions and auxilia were placed in peaceful and in volatile areas of the empire, east and west, to keep peace and spread Roman culture.
13)	Like Caesar, and Pompey before Caesar, Augustus applied the system of alliances globally: The status of provincial towns varied: there were colonies, municipia, Latin towns, and subject stipendiary cities. 
a.	At the top of the hierarchy were colonies: they were made up of resettled Roman and Italian citizens, and most were exempt from taxes. 
b.	Under the colonia, came the municipium (pl. municipia); municipia were provincial towns, whose populations were given the Roman citizenship; they paid taxes, and gradually became eligible to seek the status of colonia. 
c.	Under the municipia came Latin towns, towns with Latin rights, the special privileged status of foreigner; Latin rights were given to towns with the understanding that eventually they could earn the citizenship and become municipia. 
d.	At the bottom were subject stipendiary towns with the lowest status; they paid a tribute called a stipendium, but they would be eligible for promotion to a Latin town, eventually based on good behavior.
14)	The global application of the system of alliances (established in the 4th c BC during the Age of Italian Conquest) was now in service of the Pax Romana. The system was based on rewards for good behavior and incentives to provincial subjects to promote the policies prescribed by the emperor. Roman supervision was indirect, and based on the support and loyalty of self-governing municipia, coloniae and Latin towns. Provincial concilia and magistrates introduced Roman laws and customs, in return for such privileges as enfranchisement or exemption from taxes. The dynamics in the eastern provinces were potentially different: as former Greek city states, many were allowed to keep the organization models of the polis, an accommodation that can (also) be traced back to the policies of Pompey.
15)	The propaganda was the Pax Romana and spreading it throughout the empire. The improved administrative system and encouragement of co-operation and local responsibility were not enough. They depended on the greatest gift that Augustus could bestow upon the Roman world: peace, thanks to Rome. Augustus’ personal interest in communicating this with the provinces is reflected in his frequent tours of inspection, his taking of the local census, his establishment of the auxilia, his construction of provincial roads and finally, his introduction of the post office, the bureau of petitions and the concilium.
16)	Augustus’ Legacy Augustan policies provided a prototype for future emperors of the imperial age, that remained intact until the 4th c AD. Augustan foreign policy on the frontiers and his creation of a professional and loyal standing, peace-keeping army: i. Restored confidence. ii. Protected the empire from barbarian incursions. iii. Ushered in a new era of economic prosperity. Augustus emphasized this achievement in his magnum opus, Res Gestae, the posthumous public inscription, documenting all of his achievements, and composed, of course, by him!
Chapter 10: Trberius and Caligula 
10a. Succession 
1)	Tiberius Part I. The problem of the succession to the throne: Tiberius was elevated to the throne by the process of elimination, or survival of the fittest.
2)	These family trees underline the complexity of the Julio-Claudian family, which resulted from the practice of endogamy or marriage within bloodlines. Endogamy led to family competition, at times deadly, for political favor and promotion to the throne.
a)	Augustus: grand nephew of Julius Caesar 
b)	Tiberius: stepson of Augustus 
c)	Caligula: grand nephew of Tiberius: sone of Germanics, who is the nephew of Tiberius 
d)	Claudius: nephew of Tiberius (the brother of Germanics, uncle of Caligula) 
e)	Nero: sone of Agrippina II, who is the daughter of Agrippina I, the wife of Germanicus
3)	Succession 
a)	In 24 BC while campaigning with Agrippa in Spain, Augustus was struck down by a mysterious illness and he almost died (8b, 8-10). A senatorial conspiracy had also been uncovered in Rome. These events led him to redefine and reconsolidate his authority with the senate; the result was the Settlement of 23. It is at this time that Augustus began to lay plans for his own succession, his legacy. Hereditary succession ensured stability since it prevented a power void at the interregnum, the period between emperors.
4)	Augustus’ Succession Plan:
a)	Why was it so complicated and extensive? It appears to have pitted Julians against Claudians. In his arrangements for the succession, Augustus favored his immediate family, and he focused on the Julian clan (gens Julia). The sources (Tacitus) insinuate that Livia wanted to advance the careers of her sons Drusus and Tiberius, of the Claudian clan (gens Claudia)
5)	In 25 BC Augustus married his daughter, Julia to his nephew, Claudius Marcellus (the son of Octavia).* Augustus promoted Marcellus, but it appears that he did not adopt him as his heir apparent. Following Marcellus’ premature death in 23 BC, Augustus used Julia to bring Agrippa into his family, by pledging her in marriage to him.
6)	The sources insinuate that Augustus also feared offending Agrippa, who although a loyal supporter, harbored his own political ambitions. Augustus may even have designated Agrippa as his successor (with the gift of his signet ring); there is however no evidence that he adopted him.
7)	Yet, in 23 or 22 BC Augustus also gave the proconsular imperium to Agrippa for five years, and a command in the east to negotiate the installation of a Roman friendly king in Armenia Minor, and the future return of the Roman standards, lost in 53 BC, in the Battle of Carrhae. In 21 BC Julia was married to Agrippa, and Augustus also extended Agrippa’s imperium to the senatorial provinces; in sum, it looks like Augustus had, in essence, made Agrippa a “co-regent.”
8)	The marriage of Julia and Agrippa produced two sons, Gaius and Lucius, whom Augustus (their grandfather) adopted in 17 BC, as spare heirs. Why these complicated arrangements, with no place for his stepsons, Tiberius and Drusus? Augustus’ succession scheme was flexible, but he favored a backup of heirs with Julian blood in their veins. Agrippa may have been intended as a surrogate or temporary regent (ruler) until the grandsons came of age.
9)	Tiberius’ position was never favored, and between 12 BC and AD 2, he was alienated from Augustus. Whatever ambitions Tiberius -or Liviamay have had for him to rule, were subordinated to Augustus’ wish for a Julian successor. However, when Agrippa died in 12 BC, Augustus forced Tiberius (perhaps at Livia’s urging) to divorce Vipsania, Agrippa’s daughter,* to whom Tiberius had been happily married. The following year, 11 BC Tiberius married Julia, again a widow. The toxic marriage of Julia and Tiberius produced no children.
10)	In addition, between 12 BC and 6 BC Tiberius was given important commissions and offices. He also received the Tribunician Power for 5 years. However, in 6 BC Tiberius withdrew from public life in Rome, and went to live on Rhodes with friends. The ancient and modern sources are divided on the reason: Needed Rest? Unhappiness with marriage to Julia? Hatred (jealousy) of the grandsons Lucius and Gaius (sons of Agrippa and Julia)? A general inclination against his Julian relatives?
11)	The withdrawal of Tiberius from public life and responsibilities* alienated Augustus even more, and compromised his succession plans (for Tiberius’ marriage to Julia had produced no children with Julian blood). Gaius and Lucius, the sons of Julia and Agrippa were still too young to assume the throne. In the event he would have to choose one of the Claudian stepsons, Augustus would have preferred Drusus, Tiberius' younger brother. Presumably, Augustus would have used Drusus as a surrogate or temporary successor until the grandsons came of age. However, as we have seen, Drusus had died in 9 BC.
12)	Obvers: Head of Augustus, facing right; behind, a lituus (Augur’s staff evoking Augustus’ perpetual Augurship). Reverse: Heads of Gaius Caesar, and Lucius Caesar the son of Julia, pictured in the center; all facing right; a wreath above head of Julia.
13)	From 6 BC Augustus had refused to allow Tiberius to return to Rome, even when Livia tried to intervene on his behalf. When Tiberius’ powers ran out in 1 BC Augustus did not renew them. The sources report Tiberius was expecting to be executed (!).
14)	. However, when a ship arrived in Rhodes in AD 2, it brought news not of impending execution, but rather of the death of Lucius Augustus’ older grandson) of an illness at Massilia. The ship had been sent to recall Tiberius to Rome. In AD 4 when he learned that Gaius (the younger grandson) had also died, (of battle wounds in Armenia), Augustus finally adopted Tiberius. Devastated, without his adoptive “sons” (i.e., his grandsons) and Julian successors, consequently Augustus brought Tiberius back into public life, and reluctantly adopted him as his heir.
15)	However, Tiberius was required to adopt his nephew, Germanicus (the son of his brother, Drusus I). And worse, Tiberius was required to make Germanicus, the presumptive heir, first in line before his own son, Drusus II. This condition allowed Augustus to reestablish a pool of presumptive heirs after Tiberius, with Julian blood, the idea being that Tiberius would presumably be a surrogate, or temporary ruler. This never came about because Germanicus died in AD 19.
16)	As Augustus’ great nephew, and as the son of Antonia Minor, who was the daughter of Augustus’ sister Octavia, Germanicus was a Julian. Better still, as the daughter of Julia, Germanicus’ wife, Agrippina I, was Augustus’ granddaughter. Their children would be thoroughly Julians (!)
17)	In sum, Tiberius was forced to pass over his own son, Drusus II to adopt his nephew, Germanicus as his heir. Augustus had effectively made Tiberius a surrogate, or a temporary regent.
18)	The sources reveal that Augustus disliked Tiberius until his death; however, by AD 4 Tiberius was clearly Augustus’ successor. As military commander, Tiberius had served Augustus well in the years from 16 BC to AD 14, serving on both fronts, the Danube and the Rhine, in the wake of the deaths of Agrippa and Drusus. Tiberius had crushed revolts in Gaul, Pannonia, Illyricum and, after the Varian disaster, in Germania Magna.
19)	In AD 13, the year before his death, Augustus gave Tiberius a military triumph. Augustus also extended Tiberius’ proconsular imperium and tribunician power. Augustus made Tiberius’ proconsular power as great as his own, making him, in effect, a co-princeps with Augustus. “His position was unassailable, and the continuation of the Principate a foregone conclusion. After 55 years living at the behest of his stepfather, Tiberius finally assumed the mantle of sole power.” G. Fagan
10b. Tiberius and Germanicus 
1)	Tiberius looked like an ideal successor: He was a good soldier, popular with the armies, and a good civil administrator etc. The problem with Tiberius was that he was anti-social, awkward, gloomy, and not well-suited for the public position. Augustus had been reluctant to elevate Tiberius. The feeling was mutual: Tiberius was reluctant to be elevated.
2)	Tiberius made no constitutional adjustments until after Augustus’ funeral. The Senate met with Tiberius and decreed that Augustus would be deified posthumously. Tiberius would have the proconsular imperium (maius) and the tribunician power for life, along with all the titles that Augustus had held
3)	Main Sources for the reign of Tiberius: Tacitus Annals 1-6. Cassius Dio Roman History 57-59. Suetonius Life of Tiberius; Life of Gaius (Caligula). Josephus Jewish Wars 2. 204-17. Josephus Jewish Antiquities 18. 181-87, 205-25. Velleius Paterculus History of Rome 2. 94-131.
4)	Tiberius reluctantly accepted the title of princeps. Tacitus insinuates this self-deprecating attitude was fraudulent and calculated. However, Tiberius acted decisively and got off to a good start. Even Tacitus acknowledges this; otherwise, he portrays the emperor as a paranoid villain. Tacitus’ interpretation of Tiberius is informed by his hatred of the monarchy, and the Julio-Claudians in general, but also by his hatred of Domitian, the Flavian “tyrant emperor” during whose reign Tacitus was writing.* In actual fact, as we have seen, Tiberius was an able administrator, and a skilled commander in chief, and not excessively unfair.
5)	While the Roman defeat in AD 9 signified a severe setback, it did not end a short period of campaigning in Germania Magna. In the aftermath (AD 10-12) of the Varian disaster, Tiberius went out to the theater of war with Germanicus, where they exacted revenge and consolidated the legions resolutely and judiciously (Vell. Pat. 2, 120, 1-2). Tacitus insinuates that Tiberius was jealous of Germanicus, who was consul in AD 12 and heir apparent, but there is no evidence for this.
6)	In AD 14 the legions stationed in Pannonia and the Rhineland mutinied against the long terms of service, bad pay and harsh discipline imposed by the legates. The problems were aggravated by the fact that, because of the Pannonian revolt and Varian disaster, freedmen had been drafted into the legions. Germanicus and Drusus II quelled the respective mutinies, Germanicus typically with some difficulty and drama ( Vell. Pat 2. 125; Tacitus Ann. 1. 31-49; Suet. Tib. 25.2; Dio 57.5–6).
7)	Germanicus was forced to make large concessions to the rebellious legions of the Rhine, which did not end the unrest. He sent his pregnant wife, Agrippina I, and their infant son, Caligula, to the Treveri (Gaulish tribe in Belgica) for protection (Tac. Ann. 1. 40). Tacitus (Ann. 1. 41) reports that the troops intercepted Agrippina and Caligula, and renounced the mutiny out of shame that the Treveri, a barbarian people would be trusted over the emperor’s legions, with the safety of the imperial family. I.e., the jealousy that they harbored toward the Treveri (and the love of Germanicus’ family) was the reason that Tacitus gives for the change of heart displayed by the troops. Germanicus gave a rousing speech reproaching them, and then forgave them for stopping the mutiny (Ann 1. 42-43).
8)	In the effort to restore the morale of his troops, to emulate the deeds of his own father (Drusus I), and to avenge Quintus Varus, Germanicus became obsessed with the re-conquest of Germania Magna, and the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe that had been lost in Varian disaster.
9)	In AD 15 Germanicus led his legions across the Rhine without the authorization of Tiberius; he advanced along the Lippe against the Marsii, and from Moguntiacum against the Chatti. He also revisited the Teutoburg forest and buried the remnants of Varus’ troops; this is the context of Tacitus’ account of Varian Disaster.
10)	According to Tacitus, the expedition launched by Germanicus although not officially sanctioned by Tiberius, was popular and successful at first; Gaul supplied levies to support his legions. Germanicus was able to secure territory on the eastern bank of the Rhine, inflict casualties on the Germans, and recover two of the eagles lost by Varus (and spoliated by Arminius). Even Gaul, Spain, and Italy also supplied Germanicus with weapons, horses, and gold (Tac. Ann. 1.70). However, while the offensives, which Tacitus described as the battle to reconquer Germania, went deep into Germania Magna, they also exposed the legions to dangerous situations. And at a certain point, quite justifiably, Tiberius could not allow them to continue.
11)	That winter, during the withdrawal operations, Germanicus’ troops suffered losses and food shortages, resulting from the flooding of the North Sea. Yet in AD 16, despite of these losses, Germanicus prepared a fleet, and sailed through the lakes of Holland to the River Ems (Amisia). After two indecisive engagements he was forced to retreat, losing much of the fleet in a storm on the way back. Consequently, Tiberius recalled him because his military exploits were failing, and putting pressure on the manpower and resources of the empire.
12)	Tacitus, hostile to Tiberius, and an admirer of Germanicus, insinuates that Tiberius’ recall of Germanicus was due to Tiberius jealousy, and caused resentment and anger both in the senate and among the people. More likely, Tiberius’ actions were due to better judgement, and the futility of Germanicus’ campaigns. It was enough that Germanicus had re-established the Roman authority along the western Rhine and restored Roman defenses; the east would be lost forever. Tiberius was following what was supposed to be an established Augustan policy of campaigns and expansion only for defense; he left the Rhine frontier as Augustus had done, as a military zone of defense along the western bank with “friendly” vassal kings (and chieftains) on the eastern bank of the Rhine. This policy was informed by the massive losses suffered by the Romans in the Varian Disasater.
13)	AD 17 Military Honors: Tiberius even gave Germanicus a military triumph in AD 17. Indeed, neither Germanicus nor Tacitus would have had any grounds to complain that Tiberius was trying to undermine his nephew’s military career.
14)	In AD 18 Tiberius gave Germanicus imperium maius over all the eastern provinces as well as a consulship,* and a large command in the east. Purpose of the eastern commission: i. To put a pro-Roman, puppet-king on the throne of Lesser Armenia (again). ii. To oversee the annexation of Cappadocia (formerly a vassal under Augustus) as an imperial province. Germanicus undertook these tasks with efficiency and success.
15)	However, Tiberius had also sent Gn. Calpurnius Piso out to Syria as the Legate (military governor), to keep an eye on Germanicus. Tiberius had cause to fear that Germanicus might embroil the Romans in a conflict with the Parthians. There was mutual hatred and resentment between Germanicus and Piso; and Piso refused to submit to Germanicus’ authority in Syria. Germanicus resented being subjected to Piso’s surveillance; and while Germanicus did not bring Rome into a war, he committed several blunders that justified Tiberius’ concerns.
16)	During the campaign Germanicus committed a serious error: he left Syria and went to Egypt, - illegally- since to enter Egypt required Tiberius’ authorization. In Egypt, Germanicus, in Greek dress, accepted divine honors, opened the Egyptian granaries and lowered the price of grain to feed the masses of Alexandria (Tac.2. 59-61; Suet. Tib. 52).

10c. Death Germanicus
1)	Part Ill AD 19 Death of Germanicus
a)	When Germanicus got back to Syria he found that Piso had repudiated his acta and his orders. As Germanicus subordinate, Piso had overstepped his mandate, even if Syria was his province. Germanicus renounced his amicitia (friendship) with Piso. He also banished Piso from his company, and ordered him (according to Piso) from his post and from his province.
b)	 After Piso's departure, Germanicus died abruptly and mysteriously. Germanicus suspected that Piso had cursed him by placing devotional objects (human remains, lead tablets etc.) in his house, and that he had poisoned him. On his death bed Germanicus addressed his wife Agrippina ] Tac. 2.72. "Then he turned to his wife, and implored her "by the memory of himself, and for the sake of their common children, to strip herself of pride, to stoop her spirit before the rage of for-tune, and never, if she returned to the capital, to irritate those stronger than herself, by a competition for power." "These words in public: in private there were others, in which he was believed to hint at danger from the side of Tiberius. "It was rumored his corpse showed poison: bruises, foaming at the mouth; his heart would not burn on funeral pyre.
c)	In the meantime, Piso and his wife had fled to Cos, and then Cilicia, to see how things would play out. Piso reasserted himself and tried to regain his post in Syria as Legate. He claimed Germanicus had forced him from his province illegally, to attempt a coup against Tiberius. Piso’s re-entry to Syria with a military force was countered, and he was sent back to Rome to stand trial for treason.
d)	Tacitus (3.1) reports Agrippina I sailed for Rome with Germanicus’ ashes, and began a political campaign against Tiberius, whom she suspected of involvement in her husbands’ death. Crowds of sympathizers and partisans flocked to Brundisium to support her. The story is embedded in the popular imagination: Tacitus, who loved Germanicus, reports that huge crowds of mourners appeared to adore and eulogize Germanicus. Now, there was no love lost between Agrippina and Tiberius. Agrippina felt that Tiberius. Agrippina felt that Tiberius had snubbed Germanicus, and had held his career bakl. Agrippina probably wanted to protect the interests of her own children in the imperial court. 
e)	 THE TRIAL OF PISO Piso’s recall to Rome was largely a result of Agrippina’s demands that he stand trial for the crime of the murder of her husband. Piso’s recall to Rome is also linked by Tacitus to Tiberius’ fear of his implication in the murder of Germanicus, and the resulting necessity of damage control. The senate tried Piso and accused him of treason on a double charge of murder (by poison) and re-entering a province by force. Piso got off the murder charge, but the charge of illegally re-entering Syria, (his own province !) stuck.
f)	Realizing that his career was ruined, Piso committed suicide, it is not known, under precisely what circumstances. Tacitus insinuates nefarious activity on the part of Tiberius and Livia, who was also implicated because of her close friendship with Piso’s wife Minucia Plancina, also suspected in the murder of Germanicus. Tiberius’ supporters argued that Piso’s suicide proved his guilt; however, Tacitus reports rumors that he was executed or forced into taking his life. Whether Piso was coerced, or whether he took his own life by choice,* the death of Germanicus compromised both Tiberius, who was unpopular, and Livia, since the courts ruled Minucia was guilty, and both Livia and Tiberius (at Livia’s behest) had to intercede on her behalf. However, even after Piso's death, Tiberius ordered that he be prosecuted posthumously, and defended by his own son, (a defense lawyer); this detail is arguably incriminating, although Tacitus may be exaggerating. In sum, inevitably there were rumors of the unpopular Tiberius’ involvement in the murder of Germanicus, likely exaggerated by Tacitus. However, it has also been argued that the rumors may have been aggravated by Agrippina I and a small political circle that wanted to remove Tiberius from the throne, and promote a Julian heir, including one of the sons of Agrippina and Germanicus. Whether there was any substance to the rumors is difficult to confirm.
g)	 The narrative of the death of Germanicus raises several questions: 
i)	What motives would Tiberius have had? Did Tiberius have reason to want Germanicus dead? Was he worried that Germanicus would replace him as emperor? Did Tiberius orchestrate the death of Germanicus, (resentful of the adoption), to elevate his own son Drusus II to the throne? 
ii)	What motives would Agrippina have had? Political ambitions for her children? Revenge?
iii)	What about Livia? Tacitus’ insinuations that Livia was involved in Germanicus’ death are absurd: Germanicus’ widow, Agrippina I, was Livia’ granddaughter, and Germanicus was Augustus’ grand nephew.
h)	 The sources are hostile to Tiberius and praise Germanicus; Tacitus, in particular, hated all Julio-Claudians except for Germanicus. The people disliked Tiberius for his financial stinginess, while the Senate disliked him for his awkward manners and absenteeism from Rome. The people loved Germanicus because he had campaigned against the Germans (if not always successfully) and because he was a family man. The senate loved Germanicus, because he came from an old republicanleaning family and may have had political connections to those, who supported of the idea of the republic.
i)	Tacitus ( 2; 3. 12-16) gives the fullest report of the trial. His unfavorable treatment of Tiberius may be informed by his bias, but there also may be a kernel of truth to it. His account is contextualized by a senatorial decree (SC),* known as the Decree of the Senator Gn. Piso. The decree is believed to give the “official” and politically expedient version of the trial and its result: I.e., the version of the story Tiberius wanted people to know; it was a form of political damage control.
j)	Senatus Consultum de Cn, Pisone patre: Decree of the sentor Gn Pisa
i)	The decree, the “official” version, is inscribed on a bronze tablet. Several copies were set up all over the empire, including where the legions were stationedl seven have been found. The decree reports the Senate’s decisions in the trial of Piso in Rome in AD 20. 
2)	The decree is a response to the events Tacitus covered in his books (chapters) on Tiberius:* It provides an external (but a problematic) check on Tacitus’ account of the trial and the events that led up to it. It has been argued, based on the decree, that in Book 2 Tacitus is giving the reader an account of his version of what really happened (i.e., that Tiberius might have been involved). In Book 3 Tacitus shows how this real “truth” was obscured by rumor and suspicion, both by Tiberius’ supporters, and by Piso’s supporters.
a)	The decree shows that the official charge was treason, not poison, and that Tiberius was concerned to appear impartial: this much is consistent with Tacitus. 
b)	 The decree also shows that Tiberius tried to deflect some responsibility to the senate by stating that the senate had approved the posting of Piso in Syria, as opposed to Tiberius alone. 
c)	 This detail in Tacitus' account departs from the official version in the Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone Patre: Tacitus reports that Piso was appointed at the discretion of Tiberius to keep an eye on Germanicus, who admittedly had given him reason to doubt his judgment; and, as we have seen, Germanicus entered Egypt illegally, and disgraced himself by committing several blunders.
3)	Tacitus’ report includes the rumor that Piso had a letter from Tiberius instructing him on how to deal with Germanicus, and that Piso planned to show it to the senate to implicate Tiberius. 
4)	Tacitus also reports a rumor that Piso did not commit suicide, but rather was executed to be silenced. 3. Tacitus reports that Tiberius alone authorized the posting of Piso as Legate of Syria (not the senate as the edict states). 
5)	Tacitus reports Tiberius and Livia never publicly mourned the death of Germanicus, evincing hatred of Germanicus, (but this is hearsay).
6)	Tacitus insinuates that Livia was involved in the murder of Germanicus with the help of Plancina, the wife of Piso and great friend of Livia. Points 4 and 5 are informed by Tacitus’ hatred of Tiberius and his love of Germanicus: they are misleading and speculative; however, the first three points raise questions.
7)	How does the Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone Patre contextualize Tacitus? “ In a sense the bronze tablet corroborates Tacitus’ innuendo: the careful and detailed report that was set up in every legionary camp in the Empire shows Tiberius on the defensive and confirms that the trial was a crisis for him. Tiberius now faced a truly difficult rival. Dead, and perhaps martyred, Germanicus remained a formidable force in Roman politics.” G. Fagan
10d. Ascendancy of Sejanus 
1)	Relations between Tiberius and Germanicus’ family were strained, following his death and the trial of Piso. They collapsed when Tiberius allowed his Praetorian Prefect, Lucius Aelius Sejanus to insinuate himself into the imperial family and gain tremendous influence over him. Consequently, Sejanus convinced Tiberius that Agrippina I was involved in a plot to remove him from the throne; then he launched an assault on her family. Agrippina’s relentless hostility toward Tiberius and her belief that he had been involved in the death of her husband, alienated the emperor, and it made it easy for Sejanus to convince Tiberius that she was a threat. Prior to the downfall of Agrippina I, Sejanus allegedly conspired to murder Drusus II, Tiberius’ son, who was now the heir apparent, since Germanicus was dead.
2)	Sejanus was from an Etruscan family of equestrian standing, the son of Lucius Aelius Strabo, born between 23-20 BC in Volsinii (Tac. Ann.4,1-2). Through his father, who was made praetorian prefect in AD 14, Sejanus came into close contact with Augustus. Sejanus accompanied Gaius Caesar, the grandson and adoptive son of Augustus, on his eastern campaigns. Immediately after the elevation of Tiberius (AD 14), Sejanus was named praetorian prefect with his father, and assigned to Tiberius’ son, Drusus II as a guide during the suppression of mutinies of the Pannonian armies in AD 15 (Tac. Ann. 1, 24, 2). After his father was made prefect of Egypt in AD 15, Sejanus received the sole command of the praetorians probably in AD 16 or 17 (Dio 57, 19, 6).
3)	The death of Germanicus in AD 19 had left Tiberius’ own son, Drusus II in front running for the throne. Consequently, Tiberius began promoting Drusus II to be his successor. The sources report Sejanus immediately began to insinuate himself into the imperial family, and increasingly curried favor with Tiberius. In addition, Sejanus is reported to have turned his attentions to Livilla,* the wife of Drusus II, to advance his plan to eliminate Drusus and marry into the imperial family (Tac. 4.3).
4)	Death of Drusus AD 23 (Dio 57. 22; Tacitus 4.8) However, in AD 23, Drusus (II ), who was also a vigorous opponent of Sejanus, died. Tiberius suffered a personal blow when his son died, and it was made worse, when it was revealed eight years later, that Drusus had been murdered by his wife, Livilla, and Sejanus, with whom she had allegedly been having an affair (Tac. 4.3). In the meantime, Sejanus was now taking measures to strengthen his position, by concentrating the Praetorian cohorts into one set of permanent barracks in Rome; (normally only 3 of the 9 cohorts were posted in Rome). The decision to post the entire guard in Rome suggests Sejanus intended to consolidate his position by military force, if necessary.
5)	Whether murdered or not, the death of Drusus II, (whose murder would not be “confirmed” until AD 31), derailed Tiberius’ plans for the succession, and drove him into isolation, depression, and paranoia. The elimination of Drusus also provided an opportunity for Sejanus to insert himself into the imperial family, even more aggressively, and into Tiberius’ plans for the succession. In fact, Sejanus tried three times without success to marry into the imperial family (!). 
a)	In AD 20 Sejanus tried to betroth (pledge in engagement) his daughter, Junilla to the son of Claudius,* but the boy later choked to death on a pear in the Bay of Naples.
b)	In AD 25 Sejanus asked Tiberius for the hand of Livilla, the widow of Drusus, and eight years later, (AD 31) revealed to be Drusus’ alleged murderer and Sejanus’ lover. At the time, Tiberius refused, simply because Sejanus was a new man, and he saw him as an upstart, but not yet a political threat.
c)	Finally, in AD 30 Sejanus managed to become engaged to Livilla's daughter Julia, (Tiberius’ granddaughter) just before the conspiracy was revealed and he was accused of treason and executed.
6)	The narrative tradition is disputed and raises several questions because the ancient sources are inconsistent and vague about Sejanus’ motives and goals. Tacitus (Ann. 4.1, 3) just reports that Sejanus wanted a regnum (kingdom); he does not say that Sejanus wanted to get rid of Tiberius. Dio (57.22.4b) reports that Sejanus aimed at power. Suetonius (Tib. 48.2 65.1) reports Sejanus was a revolutionary but did want to eliminate Tiberius. Josephus (AJ 18.181) states that Sejanus led a conspiracy, but he does not specify what he wanted.
7)	Modern opinion is also divided: Some historians have imputed some blame to Agrippina I, who was so belligerent and confrontational with Tiberius, that arguably Sejanus was easily able to turn Tiberius against his niece (by marriage). Agrippina’s suspicion that Tiberius was involved in the death of her husband, Germanicus, must have had an inflammatory effect on him. But it is more likely, that Sejanus, as a new man, saw opportunities to insinuate himself into an imperial family so ridden with strife; he simply pushed too far and asked for too much. As noted, Sejanus did try three times without success to marry into the imperial family
8)	Perhaps Sejanus aimed at being to Tiberius what Agrippa might have been to Augustus: a trusted servant and surrogate (temporary or short term) regent, who would succeed Tiberius to the throne, and rule on behalf of his grandson or great nephew only until the young boy came of age. This would explain why his attacks were limited to Tiberius’ immediate heirs, Tiberius son Drusus II, and the older sons of Germanicus, (Drusus and Nero). Sejanus did not try to harm the “long term” heirs, the children who were too young to take the throne, like (Gaius) Caligula, the youngest son of Germanicus, and Tiberius’ grandson Gemellus, the surviving twin son of Drusus II. Both boys were too young to succeed Tiberius in AD 23 when Drusus II died.
9)	In other words (as Levick and Shotter had argued): Sejanus did not want to eliminate Tiberius, he just wanted to succeed him, meaning replace him for a limited period of time until his (Tiberius’) grandson or great nephew could take the throne. This much may be revealed in two comments in the sources: Tacitus (Ann. 4.3): “house full of Caesars was an obstacle to Sejanus’ plans.” Dio (57.22.4b): “Sejanus wanted to succeed Tiberius.” (i.e., not necessarily kill him (!)
10)	There is also the issue of Sejanus’ involvement in the death of Drusus II: Modern historians debate the circumstances of his death: Did Sejanus conspire with Livilla (wife of Drusus II) to murder Drusus? Or Did Drusus just die by accident ? In the latter case, did Sejanus just take advantage of the new vacancy, and attempt to marry Livilla, who was now Drusus’ widow? Either scenario would fit the motive of wanting merely to be a temporary or surrogate heir or regent.
11)	Arguably, the gap of eight years between the death of Drusus II and the revelation of his murder by conspiracy strains belief. Tacitus (Ann. 4.3-8 ) and Dio (57.22.) report Sejanus seduced Livilla and then they poisoned Drusus II in AD 23. However, there was no suspicion of foul play in Drusus’ death until AD 31 when Sejanus’ ex-wife exposed the murder in a suicide note,* after which Sejanus was charged with treason against Tiberius. Both Tacitus and Dio were writing long after the event, and it is probable that many details of the story were inserted and developed in the reigns of the Flavian emperors, decades later, after the conspiracy of Sejanus.
12)	At the time of Drusus’ death in AD 23, Tiberius had no suspicion of foul play. Tiberius forbade Sejanus’ marriage to Livilla, not because he suspected Sejanus in the death of his son, but rather because he felt Sejanus to be unworthy, and socially beneath the dignity of his niece (and former daughter-in-law).
13)	Livilla: wife, widow and cousin of Drusus II; daughter of Antonia Minor and Drusus I; niece and daughter-in-law of Tiberius. The Julio-Claudians practiced endogamy, or marriage within the family. We have moved into a period of competition and treachery within families (and reported in the sources)! Family members competed for political promotion and access to the throne.
14)	Right: Germanicus with of three of his six children portrayed as infants. These glass medallions were worn as badges on military uniforms and were issued to promote a sense of identity within the army, loyalty to the commander-in-chief, the emperor and to family values. Sometime after the death of Drusus II, to clear the way to the throne, Sejanus allegedly began to lay plans to eliminate the two older sons of Germanicus and Agrippina I, Nero* and Drusus, whom Tiberius had adopted as spare heirs. The youngest son, Gaius Caligula, who ruled after Tiberius, was too young to be named as heir, and consequently was left unharmed.
15)	Eventually Sejanus invoked the treason laws to get rid of them: But as early as AD 24 or 25, he began to plant in Tiberius’ mind jealous fears of Agrippina I, her children and their friends. And so, the family of Agrippina I and Germanicus became the victims of Sejanus and Tiberius. Agrippina continued to make this easy for Sejanus with her relentless hostility and belligerence toward Tiberius.
16)	Cameo of Tiberius; In AD 26 bereft of his son, Tiberius left Rome and took refuge in his villain Campania. With Tiberius out of Rome, Sejanus stepped up his attack, and charged Agrippina I and her older sons with treason. In fact, he trumped up false charges of sexual impropriety into crimes against the state; he also tried Agrippina’s friends and her supporters in the courts (Tacitus 5. 3; Dio 58. 3. 8-9; 58. 8. 4)
17)	AD 29 After the death of Livia, Sejanus upped the ante again (!) He convinced Tiberius that Agrippina I was involved in a conspiracy to take the throne. Tiberius may have feared Agrippina’s continued popularity with the armies on the Rhine, and the continued political currency of her late husband, Germanicus. Livia had harbored suspicions about Sejanus, and the sources report, that her death emboldened him. After Livia’s death, Sejanus advised Tiberius to send Agrippina I and her two older sons to prison.
18)	Agrippina was sent to Pandateria, an island in the bay of Naples. The oldest son, Nero was imprisoned on the island of Pontia, off the coast of southern Latium. The second son, Drusus was imprisoned in Rome
10e. Fall of Sejanus 
1)	In AD 31 the conspiracy of Sejanus was uncovered, and he was executed (Dio 58. 9 1-6). The narrative of Sejanus’ fall, and the aftermath must have been included in Book 5 of Tacitus but was among the missing parts. In October of AD 31 Tiberius finally turned against Sejanus, as Dio reports, convinced of his wickedness and corruption both by the people and senate, although the sources also name specific whistle blowers. Consequently, Tiberius created a scheme to lull Sejanus into believing he would be named his successor and get him to come into the senate.
2)	Tiberius wrote Sejanus (from Campania) that he intended to give him the tribunician power, a form of power given to a co-ruler who is to be named as heir apparent. Then he took away Sejanus’ consulship (without telling him) and replaced him with P. Memmius Regulus. He also named a new praetorian prefect, Surtorius Macro, who was mandated to execute him. What Sejanus thought was a letter of commendation, was in fact, a letter of condemnation. As the letter was read outloud in the senate, his followers and his detractors turned against him (Dio 58. 10. 1-8).
3)	Sejanus had been making great progress, and his entry into the imperial house now seemed imminent. 
a)	In AD 30 he was engaged to Livilla’s (Drusus widow’s) daughter (and Tiberius’ granddaughter) Julia. 
b)	In AD 31 he held a consulship with Tiberius, and was also granted proconsular power, honors normally restricted to heirs to the throne . 
c)	So, when he was summoned by Tiberius to the Senate later that year Sejanus expected to receive tribunician power, an award made to an heir apparent. Sejanus had no idea that Tiberius had been informed of his crimes.
d)	The letter of summons sent by Tiberius from Campania was read out in the senate in its entirety:
e)	At first it praised Sejanus, but then abruptly denounced him as a traitor and demanded his arrest. vi. Following the reading, there was chaos and violence: senators who had allied with Sejanus fled in fear and confusion. 
f)	The Praetorian Guard, now under Surtorius Macro, arrested Sejanus, imprisoned him, and executed him. 
g)	A “witch-hunt” followed, which lasted until AD 33 (Tacitus calls it a “reign of terror.”) ix. Sejanus’s followers and friends were imprisoned, tried and executed (Dio 58.10.1-11).
4)	Sejanus’ family was punished brutally. His children were murdered, the little girl raped, so she would seem suitably old enough to be executed. Apicata, Sejanus’ ex-wife sent a letter to Tiberius, outlining the details of the conspiracy (information had been obtained by torturing slaves) before she committed suicide. In the letter, she declared that Sejanus and Livilla (Drusus’ widow) had conspired together as lovers to murder Drusus (Dio 58. 11. 5-7).
5)	Cruelty as only the Romans can commit: Dio 58.11. 5-7 5. “His children also were put to death by decree, the girl (whom he had betrothed to the son of Claudius) having been first outraged* by the public executioner on the principle that it was un-lawful for a virgin to be put to death in the prison. 6. His wife Apicata was not condemned, to be sure, but on learning that her children were dead, and after seeing their bodies on the stairway, she withdrew and composed a statement about the death of Drusus, directed against Livilla, his wife, who had been the cause of a quarrel between herself and her husband, resulting in their separation; then, after sending this document to Tiberius, she committed suicide.”
6)	Suetonius (Tib.61) reports Tiberius himself took credit for uncovering the conspiracy, although the revelation brought out the emperor’s most sadistic tendencies. As Suetonius, himself notes, his discovery raises the question of why Tiberius allowed Agrippina and her sons to die in prison in the year of the revelation in the case of Nero, or two years after it, in the case of Agrippina and Drusus. “Presently he broke out into every form of cruelty, for which he never lacked occasion, venting it on the friends and even the acquaintances, first of his mother, then of his grandsons and daughter-in-law, and finally of Sejanus. After the death of Sejanus, he was more cruel than ever, which showed that his favorite was not wont to egg him on, but on the contrary gave him the opportunities which he himself desired. Yet in a brief and sketchy autobiography which he composed he had the assurance to write that he had punished Sejanus because he found him venting hatred on the children of his son Germanicus. Whereas in fact he had himself put one of them to death after he had begun to suspect Sejanus and the other after the latter's downfall. However, this is not consistent with the fact that Tiberius allowed the deaths of Agrippina and her children to proceed (Sejanus had imprisoned them) in spite of uncovering the conspiracy.”
7)	Tiberius hated Agrippina’s pugnacious and abrasive manner, and allegedly feared her popularity with the amines. He banished her to Pandateria, where she died in AD 33 of starvation either forces, or self-imposed. Suetonius reports she lost an eye in adight with a centurion. 
8)	Having been declared enemies of the state, Agrippina's sons were imprisoned and murdered (Suet Tib. 54;Tac. Ann. 6.23) Nero was banished to the island of Pontia, and killed or encouraged to kill himself in AD 31, just before the crimes of Sejanus were revealed. According to Suetonius, he put an end to his own life when the executioner appeared before him with the instruments of his death.
9)	Drusus, was imprisoned on the Palatine, in the cellar of the palace, and starved to death in AD 33. Tacitus 6. 23: "Drusus passed away, after sustaining life through eight full days by the pitiable resource of chewing the stuffing of his mattress."
10)	Dio (58. 8. 4; 22. 4-5) states unequivocally that Tiberius was involved in their deaths and underlines the vengeful cruelty evinced by Tiberius. 22. 4 “All this brought disgrace upon the emperor, and his connexion with the death of Drusus and Agrippina gave him a reputation for cruelty. 22. 5 They were exceedingly grieved, partly because of the deed itself and partly because, so far from depositing their bones in the imperial tomb, * Tiberius ordered their remains to be hidden so carefully somewhere underground that they could never be found.”
11)	According to an alternate tradition found in Josephus (18.4.6), it was Antonia Minor, who notified Tiberius of the conspiracy of Sejanus. This later version (dating to Flavian times [ca AD 70]) may be connected to the “currency” of Antonia, as a result of her former slave, Caenis’ informal “marriage” to Vespasian (in concubinage). 6. “Antonia had also been the greatest benefactress to Tiberius when there was a very dangerous plot laid against him by Sejanus; a man who had been her husband’s friend, and who had the greatest authority, because he was general of the army, and when many members of the senate, and many of the freedmen joined with him, and the soldiery was corrupted, and the plot was come to a great height. Now Sejanus had certainly gained his point, had not Antonia’s boldness been more wisely conducted than Sejanus’ malice. For when she had discovered his designs against Tiberius, Antonia wrote him an exact account of the whole; and gave the letter to Pallas, the most faithful of her servants, and sent him to Capreæ, to Tiberius, who, when he understood it, executed Sejanus and his accomplices, so that Tiberius, who had her in great esteem before, now looked upon her with still greater respect, and depended upon her in all matters.”
12)	Exposed by Apicata, and her own mother, Antonia, Livilla was imprisoned and starved to death. Suetonius 62 “Tiberius increased his cruelty and carried it to greater lengths, exasperated by what he learned about the death of his son Drusus. At first supposing that he had died of disease, due to his bad habits, on finally learning that he had been poisoned by the treachery of his wife, Livilla and Sejanus, there was no one whom Tiberius spared from torment and death.” Dio 58. 11. 7. “It was in this way that Tiberius came to read Apicata’s statement; and when he had obtained proof of the information given, he put to death Livilla, and all the others therein mentioned. I have, indeed, heard that Tiberius spared Livilla out of regard for her mother Antonia, and that Antonia herself of her own accord, killed her daughter by starving her.”

14)	Tacitus: Tiberius’ “Reign of Terror” The exposure of the conspiracy of Sejanus pushed Tiberius into action that Tacitus characterizes as a reign of terror. Tiberius retaliated with new treason laws, which some scholars have qualified as heavy handed. However, others refute this characterization, noting that the number of actual executions was kept low, and they were restricted to those who were clearly complicit in Sejanus’ conspiracy.
15)	G. Fagan does not believe Tacitus exaggerated: “One area of administration where Tiberius did diverge from Augustan practice was his increasingly frequent invocation of the treason law (maiestas) to attack his enemies. Since his working relationship with the Senators was not a good one, repression was a convenient method in dealing with them. This legislation was one of Sejanus’ chief tools, but Tiberius himself used it liberally. Dozens of Senators and equites are on record as having fallen to it. It was a precedent followed in later years by emperors more tyrannical still than Tiberius had ever been.”
16)	Conspiracy of Sejanus Timeline AD 23 death of Drusus II AD 24 Sejanus begins insinuating self and persecuting family of Agrippina I. Caligula lives with his grandmother Antonia Minor: Sejanus does not harm him because he is too young to be a threat. Was Sejanus hoping to be a custodial regent? AD 25 Sejanus tries to marry Livilla. Tiberius refuses him on social grounds. AD 26 Tiberius leaves Rome and goes to Capri; invokes treason laws to eliminate Agrippina I and two older sons. AD 29 Livia dies: Sejanus ups the ante throws Agrippina I, Drusus and Nero in prison. AD 30 Sejanus is engaged to Livilla’s (Drusus’ widow) daughter (Tiberius’ granddaughter) Julia. AD 31 Sejanus holds consulship with Tiberius. Nero is executed or commits suicide just before revelation of conspiracy. AD 31 conspiracy is revealed. AD 33 Agrippina I and Drusus perish in prison, after the revelation of the conspiracy. 
10f. Domestic and foreign policy 
1)	PART VI: Administration 
a)	Civil Administration and Government (Senate) The first part of Tiberius’ reign was characterized by excellent civil administration. Tacitus himself reports that all went well until the death of Tiberius’ son Drusus II in AD 23, and Tiberius’ retreat into self-imposed exile in AD 26. There is a tradition in the sources, of a ruler making a promising start, and then descending into tyranny, because of some catastrophic event, in this case, the death of Drusus II.
i)	Conservative Fiscal and Religious policies: Tiberius disapproved of oriental cults, Druidism, games and entertainments. Tiberius limited entertainments to save money, and took measures with the senate to curb these in Rome. Tiberius’ austerity combined with his gloomy manner and stern demeanor was despised by the masses, however when he died, he had left the treasury topped up.
ii)	Tiberius promoted the efficient administration of provinces, careful but fair taxation, curbs on corruption, and austere spending. He created a large surplus in the treasury that allowed him to give financial relief to Italy and the provinces. In AD 33 there was a financial crisis in Rome. Tiberius passed a law requiring creditors to invest two thirds of their capital in Italian land, to promote the economy. He also established a trust fund to give interest-free loans to assist small landowners.
b)	Restoration of Privileges to the Senate: Tiberius allowed free debate in the senate, and even restored some privileges Augustus had repudiated. Tiberius transferred the administration of elections to the senate, and eliminated participation by the people. This constitutes a break with the Augustan policy of destinatio, where elections were in the hands of the ten voting centuries of new members of the senatorial class and equestrians, who were to vote based on the nominees chosen by Augustus. Tiberius chose nominees sparingly, allowing the senate to make the first selections for competitions, however the system promoted corruption and patronage appointments, just as the system of destinatio had done during Augustus’ reign.
i)	Tiberius also enhanced the judicial functions of the senate by making it the chief court for treason and criminal offenses committed by senators and high-ranking equestrians. In addition, Tiberius gave the Senate jurisdiction over the administration of jurisprudence in not only its own senatorial provinces, but also in the imperial provinces (!). While this mandate was aimed at promoting the efficient implementation of the law, it was also caused by Tiberius’ desire to be less involved in matters of imperial staffing, as he began to spend less time in Rome, after the death of his son.
2)	Foreign Policy and Provincial Administration Tiberius did not seek to expand the frontiers in Pannonia and the Rhineland as Augustus had done, largely because of the losses suffered by Rome in the Varian disaster. However, he made changes to the imperial frontiers in the eastern empire. In AD 17/18 when the client kings of Cappadocia and Commagene died, Tiberius annexed their kingdoms as the single province of Cappadocia.
a)	Judaea The Legate of Syria, Lucius Vitellius had to intervene in Judaea, where the prefect, Pontius Pilatus (AD 26-36) had massacred the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim.* Vitellius sent Pilate to Rome to stand trial, and made peace with the Jewish population by restoring privileges to the high priests.
i)	In the reign of Tiberius, under Pontius Pilate in Judaea, Jesus was condemned to crucifixion without any clear evidence of involvement in Jewish political meetings or subversion.
b)	Conservative Foreign Policy
i)	Tiberius made only small changes on the Danubian and Rhine frontiers, following the Varian disaster and the Great Illyrian Rebellion. In AD 15 he consolidated the southeast frontier of the Balkans, by combining the senatorial provinces of Achaea and Macedonia with the imperial province of Moesia. The new imperial province was governed by a Legate based in Moesia.
c)	Tiberius awarded the kingdom of Thrace to Rhoemetalces II in AD 19. In AD 12, Augustus had divided the kingdom of Thrace between two Thracian kings, Rhascuporis and Cotys, the son of king Rhoemetalces (I), who was the brother of Rhascuporis. The brothers Rhascuporis and Rhoemetalces (I) were friends of the Roman people, and they had fought with Tiberius against Bato and the Pannonians (Dio 55, 30, 6). After Augustus’ death and despite the intervention of Tiberius, Rhascuporis overthrew his nephew and co-ruler, Cotys, and killed him. Consequently, in AD 19 Antonia Tryphaena (Cotys' widow) went to Rome, and she petitioned for the formal accusation and trial of Rhascuporis. On the orders of Tiberius, Rhascuporis was lured to Rome, put on trial in front of the senate, convicted, exiled to Alexandria, and executed. Cotys' son, Rhoemetalces (II) was given the kingdom of Thrace (Tac. Ann. 2, 64-67; 3, 38, 2; Vell. Pat. 2, 129, 1; Suet. Tib. 37, 4). Thrace was annexed as a province much later in AD 125
d)	Suetonius Tiberius 37.4 “He undertook no campaign after his accession, but quelled outbreaks of the enemy through his generals; and even this he did only reluctantly and of necessity. Such kings as were disaffected and objects of his suspicion he held in check by threats and protests rather than by force. Some he lured to Rome by flattering promises and detained there: Maroboduus the German, Rhascuporis the Thracian, and Archelaus of Cappadocia, whose realm he reduced to a province.” (below left coin of Cotys with Victory on reverse; right Province of Thrace annexed in AD 125)
e)	2. AD 21 Revolt in Gaul A rebellion was led by two Romanized, Gallic nobles, Julius Florus and Julius Sacrovir. The causes of the trouble were: i. Economic distress, stemming from the efforts (earlier) of Germanicus east of the Rhine, where unhappy legions had encouraged the Gauls to revolt. ii. The extortion of the Gauls by Roman equestrian businessmen. iii. Resentment on the part of the Romanized aristocratic provincials at not being as favored now, as they had been, when the Romans were terrified of the Germans after the Varian disaster, and had sought the support of the local (Romanized) aristocracy.
f)	Both Augustus and Tiberius repressed Druidism because they regarded it as a dangerous agent of the promotion of anti-Roman, Gallic nationalism. It also involved human sacrifice and ritual murders. Augustus had forbidden Roman citizens in Gaul to practice Druidism but had allowed the Gallic provincials to practice their religion. Tiberius, who was conservative on matters of religion, tried to suppress the Druid priesthoods altogether, and to impose new harsher restrictions on provincials.
g)	The revolt was easily suppressed by the legions of Gaius Silius, the legate of Upper Germany. It had a detrimental effect on Rome’s relations with Romanized Gauls and vassal tribes alike. In addition, propaganda was spread by antiTiberian operatives, who accused the emperor of not dealing with it in a decisive manner. Tacitus likely exaggerates Tiberius’ indecision in this matter. Whereas previously the Germans had been the object of Roman fears, now it was the Gauls.
h)	Provinces in Sum: Tiberius’ reign was marked by good provincial administration. Uprisings were relatively insignificant, and there was peace and prosperity in the provinces under Tiberius. He chose good governors, promoted the welfare of provinces, and kept tributes and taxes low. He restricted the publicani (equestrian tax farmers) to minor customs duties, and punished extortionists and profiteers severely
i)	Continuation of Augustan principles To make governors accountable, Tiberius raised their salaries and lengthened their terms of office. Tiberius also promoted the concilia, the provincial assemblies that evaluated a governors’ work and reported directly to the emperor. Tiberius encouraged members to send delegates to Rome to lodge complaints and keep the emperor apprised. He built more roads and bridges, and urbanized provincial cities to expedite frontier defense and encourage trade and communications in the provinces. Sometimes his policies were paramilitary and heavy-handed; they provoked a revolt in Africa (10g).
j)	Last Years The death of Drusus and the revelation of the conspiracy of Sejanus triggered depression and a long seclusion in the last years of Tiberius’ reign. Rumors (Suetonius) that Tiberius spent his time in Campania, engaged in deviant sexual practices cannot be substantiated, but his absence from Rome did cause problems. It damaged the welfare of the state, resulted in the death of Agrippina’s family and contributed to Tiberius’ hostile legacy. Though not suited for public office, Tiberius was not a bad ruler: Theodor Mommsen called Tiberius the ablest ruler Rome had ever had.
k)	Consolidating the succession became urgent as Tiberius aged. Gemellus, the surviving twin son of Drusus II was still too young for the throne. Germanicus’ brother Claudius, [who would rule] was too “ill.” Tiberius adopted his grandnephew Gaius (Caligula) as his heir.
l)	Rumors circulated that Caligula and the praetorian prefect Macro had taken measures to accelerate his death. And once on the throne, Caligula allegedly killed Gemellus, Tiberius’ surviving grandson.(11a) When Tiberius died the people cheered, “Into the Tiber for Tiberius!” The senate also refused to accord Tiberius divine honors: he was not deified like his predecessor.
m)	Tacitus (6. 50) insinuates that Caligula and Macro were involved: Tiberius stopped breathing, and Caligula was being celebrated as emperor; then when news arrived that Tiberius had revived and was recovering, those who had moments before recognized Caligula as emperor, fled in fear of Tiberius’ anger, while Macro took advantage of the chaos to have Tiberius smothered in his bedclothes. Macro is shown here smothering Tiberius.
n)	Tacitus Annals 6. 50 “Tiberius’ bodily powers were now leaving him, but not his skill in dissembling. There was the same stern spirit; he had his words and looks under strict control, and occasionally would try to hide his weakness, evident as it was, by a forced politeness. After frequent changes of place, he at last settled down on the promontory of Misenum in a country-house once owned by Lucius Lucullus. There it was noted, in this way, that he was drawing near his end. There was a physician, distinguished in his profession, of the name of Charicles, usually employed, not indeed to have the direction of the emperor's varying health, but to put his advice at immediate disposal. This man, as if he were leaving on business his own, clasped his hand, with a show of homage, and touched his pulse. Tiberius noticed it. Whether he was displeased and strove the more to hide his anger, is a question; at any rate, he ordered the banquet to be renewed, and sat at the table longer than usual, by way, apparently, of showing honor to his departing friend. Charicles, however, assured Macro that his breath was failing and that he would not last more than two days. All was at once hurry; there were conferences among those on the spot and dispatches to the generals and armies. On the 16th of March, his breath failing, he was believed to have expired, and Caligula was going forth with a numerous throng of congratulating followers to take the first possession of the empire, when suddenly news came that Tiberius was recovering his voice and his sight and calling for persons to bring him food to revive him from his faintness. Then ensued a universal panic, and while the rest fled hither and thither, everyone feigning grief or ignorance, Caligula, in silent stupor, passed from the highest hopes to the extremity of apprehension. Macro, nothing daunted, ordered the old emperor to be smothered under a huge heap of clothes, and all to leave the entrance-hall.”
o)	Tacitus “Obituary” of Tiberius Book 6. 51 “The son of Nero, on both sides he traced his origin to the Claudian house, though his mother, by successive acts of adoption, had passed into the Livian and, later, the Julian families. From earliest infancy he experienced the hazards of fortune. At first the exiled attendant of a proscribed father, he entered the house of Augustus in the quality of step-son; only to struggle against numerous rivals during the heyday of Marcellus and Agrippa and, later, of Gaius and Lucius Caesar; while even his brother Drusus was happier in the love of his countrymen. But his position was the most precarious after his preferment to the hand of Julia, when he had to tolerate, or to elude, the infidelities of his wife. Then came the return from Rhodes; and he was master of the heirless imperial house for twelve years, and later arbiter of the Roman world for virtually twenty-three. His character, again, has its separate epochs. There was a noble season in his life and fame while he lived a private citizen or a great official under Augustus; an inscrutable and disingenuous period of hypocritical virtues while Germanicus and Drusus remained; with his mother alive, he was still an amalgam of good and evil; so long as he loved or feared Sejanus, he was loathed for his cruelty, but his lust was veiled. Finally, when the restraints of shame and fear were gone, and nothing remained but to follow his own bent, he plunged impartially into crime and into ignominy.”
10g. Tiberius in Africa 
1)	During Tiberius’ reign, the most serious revolt broke out in Africa Proconsularis, a senatorial province, but armed with one legion (III). It was led by the Numidian renegade Tacfarinas, a deserter from a Roman unit of auxiliary troops. The increasingly punitive, military and heavy-handed foreign policies of Tiberius in Africa were the cause: Roman urbanization had led to the forced migrations and forced settlement of the indigenous populations.

The increasingly punitive, military and heavy-handed foreign policies of Tiberius in Africa were the cause: Roman urbanization had led to the forced migrations and forced settlement of the indigenous populations.
3)	A series of commanders was sent out to command the III Legion and quell Tacfarinas. Finally, the proconsul (and governor) of Africa, Publius Cornelius Dolabella defeated him. Subsequently Africa settled into long period of relative peace and prosperity. Under Tiberius there was more urbanization in North Africa than under Augustus
4)	Post Augustan imperialism in Africa: The Julio-Claudians In the 1st c. AD Roman policies in Africa became more intrusive, aggressive, paramilitary and punitive; Julio-Claudian policies were aimed at: a. The extension of Roman sovereignty [by force if necessary] over nomadic tribes in Numidia and southern Africa Proconsularis. b. The commercial development of relatively unromanized parts of western North Africa, and the consolidation of assets and older parts of North Africa in the eastern areas around Carthage. A note on geography and culture labels: The Romans called these indigenous populations of North Africa (west of Cyrenaica and Egypt), in the geographical area known as the Maghreb, Numidians, Libyans and Mauretanians. The Maghreb comprises western and central North Africa, including Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. The term Berber is conventionally used as a linguistic and cultural label for these indigenous people. Berber is an Arab misnomer of the Greek term, barbarian. The term continued to be used by Europeans and we use it today.
5)	Legio III was permanently stationed in Africa Proconsularis. Post Augustan foreign policy would require a more intrusive and violent response to control the movement of the nomadic Berbers. The settlement of nomads was necessary for the assessment of assets and resources to collect taxes in Africa; in addition a census was undertaken for this purpose. The forced settlement or 'sedentarism' of the Berbers created hostilities between the Romans and indigenous populations.
6)	Tacitus (Annals Books 2-4) reports on Roman imperialism in Africa in the first century AD: Soldiers from the Third Legion were scattered in provincial cities during the summer. During the winter, when the Berbers migrated to the north, soldiers were sent to paramilitary camps/fortlets (castella) on the northern fringe of the Sahara to control entry into the north. The Romans also built fortified roads with more castella to act as barriers to keep Berbers down in the south. Mile stones which cut across southern Tunisia from Tacape to Capsa attest to this type of containment. The Romans did not understand the need of the Berbers to practice transhumance to take advantage of the tiny rainfall.
7)	The Roman also used force to control farm land and water sources. Fortified castella were built at water sources and the land around them was farmed. Consequently towns grew around these developed resources. Towns were made up of Roman soldiers-veterans, and Roman and Latin colonists,* as well Punic and some Berber colonists. A multi-layered culture is in evidence in the archaeological record.
8)	Transhumance is a type of pastoralism or nomadism, involving the seasonal movement of livestock between fixed summer (higher pastures) and winter (lower valleys) locations.
9)	Tiberian policies led to soldiers and surveyors becoming one and the same. Military surveyors were mandated to:
a)	prepare land for settlement.
b)	mark off tiny plots for Berbers.
c)	establish areas and fortify them to restrict access to Berbers.
d)	inventory land plots for the census, to assess taxes and assets .
e)	use military force if necessary to implement the above provision
10)	The intrusive and restrictive policies of Tiberius also led to a serious revolt in Africa, by the indigenous populations, the subjects of Juba II, who was unable to control them. Continuous unrest forced Juba II to constantly seek help from Rome. The Revolt is known as the Revolt of Tacfarinas; it lasted from AD 17-AD 24.
11)	 As early as AD 6 the Gaetuli and the Musulami from Theveste (Proconsularis) began to revolt against Juba Il and Roman rule. There was on and off fighting, until AD 17, when the most serious revolt of the period broke out. Juba II was based at Iol (Caesarea).
12)	A dangerous, angry coalition of these tribes was led by Tacfarinas a Numidian renegade and deserter, who had served in a Roman auxiliary unit.* Tacfarinas became the champion of all Berbers, and he fought a guerilla campaign that was difficult for the Romans to stop because Juba II was weak and unable to subdue these tribes. In addition, the conflict between the demands of Roman agriculture and urbanization, and the traditional grazing rights and nomadic norms of Berber pastoralists, created a great deal of unhappiness and unrest amongst the indigenous Berbers. The theater of war was Téboursouk in eastern Numidia and western Proconsularis.
13)	The immediate and specific cause of the revolt in AD 17 was the prohibition by the Romans, of local tribes from using lands in eastern Numidia for grazing their animals, in order to practice transhumance, the seasonal movement of herds from sub-desert areas to the mountains: This led to a siege by Tacfarinas, of a Roman fort (castellum) in Téboursouk in response to which the Romans declared war. There was on and off fighting for 7 years.
14)	The Senate authorized several commands however they failed to stop Tacfarinas. As the war went on, Tacfarinas even sent an embassy in AD 21 to Tiberius in Rome, to demand land for his people. Tiberius, who was insulted that a Berber renegade deserter had approached him, and had treated him as his equal, is reported to have replied, "not even Spartacus himself dared to send en-voys," and he upped the ante. Latter in AD 21, Tiberius sent the 9th Hispana Legion under Publius Cornelius Scipio to assist Quintus Junius Blaesus, the new governor of Africa Proconsularis, who was commanding the 3rd Legion (III Augusta).
15)	Blaesus began to break the resistance, and successfully put down the revolt in AD 23, but only after: 
a)	 A series of negotiations, including pardons for the Roman equestrian merchants, who had supported Tacfarinas to accelerate the siege and end the war, so that they could get commercial business back to normal * 
b)	 The capture of Tacfarinas’ brother (in the interior of Numidia), assisted by P.C. Scipio, while Blaesus’son protected the regions in the northwest.
16)	Tacitus III.74 “Since it was noticed that the African, overmatched in solid fighting strength but more expert in the petty knaveries of war, operated with a number of bands, first attacking, then vanishing, and always manoeuvring for an ambuscade, arrangements were made for three forward movements and three columns to execute them. One, in charge of the legate Cornelius Scipio, held the road by which the enemy raided the Leptitanians,* and then fell back upon the Garamantians. On another side, the younger Blaesus** marched with his own division to prevent the hamlets of Cirta from being ravaged with impunity. In the center, with the flower of the troops, was the commander himself;*** who, by securing the appropriate positions with fortresses or entrenchments, had rendered the whole district cramped and dangerous for his enemies. Turn where they would, they found some part of the Roman forces on the front, on the flank, often in the rear; and numbers were destroyed or entrapped by these methods.”
17)	“Next, Blaesus subdivided his tripartite army into yet more numerous detachments, headed by centurions of tested courage. Not even when summer was spent would he fall in with custom by withdrawing his men and quartering them for a winter's rest in the Old Province (Africa Vetus). Precisely as though he stood on the threshold of a campaign, he arranged his chain of forts, and with flying columns of men familiar with the deserts, kept hounding Tacfarinas from one desert camp to another; until at last, after capturing the renegade's brother, he returned; too hastily, however, for the interests of the province, since he left those behind him, who were capable of resuscitating the war. Tiberius, however, chose to treat it as ended, and even conferred upon Blaesus the privilege of being saluted Imperator by his legions: this was a time-honored tribute to generals who, after a successful campaign, were acclaimed by the joyful and spontaneous voice of a conquering army. Several might hold the title simultaneously, nor did it raise them above an equality with their colleagues. It was awarded in a few cases even by Augustus; and now for the last time Tiberius assigned it to Blaesus.”
18)	Blaesus returned to Rome in AD 23 and celebrated a triumph. However in AD 31 his nephew, Sejanus was accused of treason and executed.* As an associate of Sejanus, Blaesus was put on trial and also charged with treason. (10d, 10€). While awaiting his execution, he committed suicide to save the family fortune.
19)	However, the next year Tacfarins returned and started to build a new army. He besieged another Roman castellum at Teboursouk in AD 24. This time the Third Legion was able to overcome him. 
20)	AD 24: Dolabella is Proconsul (governor) of Africa Proconsularis Publius Cornelius Dolabella was from the patrician branch of the Cornelii and served as consul in AD 10 (CIL VI 1384). He was consular governor of Dalmatia under Augustus and Tiberius until AD 20; at the time of Augustus’ death and the transfer of power to Tiberius, his troops kept the peace (Vell. Pat. 2, 125, 5) in Rome; and he often presented bills in the Senate designed to provide for more effective administration in the provinces, which were favored by Tiberius. As Proconsul of Africa in 24 he defeated Tacfarinas definitely in a battle that led to his (Tacfarinas’) death; however, unlike Blaesus, his predecessor, who received military honors for a victory which did not effectively eliminate Tacfarinas, Dolabella was denied a military triumph by the emperor. Tacitus insinuates that this was because of the stature Blaesus’ nephew, Sejanus, who at this time, (i.e., before the conspiracy was revealed) was influential and powerful in the imperial court as Tiberius’ Praetorian Prefect (Tac. Ann. 4, 23-26).
21)	Tacitus Book 4. 23-26 Dolabella Defeats Tacfarinas with the troops of Ptolemy, son of Juba II, vassal king of Mauretania. 23. “This year (24) at last freed the Roman nation from the long-drawn war with the Numidian Tacfarinas. For earlier commanders, once they considered their exploits sufficient for a grant of triumphal decorations, usually left the enemy in peace; and already three laurelled statues adorned the capital, while Tacfarinas was still harrying Africa, reinforced by contingents of Moors, who, during the heedless youth of Juba's son Ptolemy, had sought in war a change from royal freedmen and servile despotism. The Garamantian king acted as the receiver of his booty and the partner of his forays, not to the extent of taking the field with an army, but by dispatching lightarmed troops, whose numbers report magnified in proportion to the distance; and from the province itself every man of broken fortunes or turbulent character rushed to his standard with an alacrity all the greater because, after the successes of Blaesus, the emperor, as though no enemies were left in Africa, had ordered the ninth legion back (to Spain), nor had Publius Dolabella, proconsul for the year and more apprehensive of the emperor's orders than of the chances of war, ventured to detain it (i.e. the legion).”
22)	24 “Accordingly, after launching a report that other nations as well were engaged on the dismemberment of the Roman Empire, which on that account was step by step evacuating Africa, while the garrison remaining might be cut off by the combined onslaught of all who preferred liberty to bondage, Tacfarinas increased his strength, established a camp, and invested the town of Thubuscum. Dolabella, on the other hand, mustered every available man, and, through the terrors of the Roman name and the inability of the Numidians to face embattled infantry, raised the siege at his first advance and fortified the various strategic points: at the same time, he brought the chieftains of the Musulami, who were contemplating rebellion to the block. Then, as several expeditions against Tacfarinas had shown that a nomadic enemy was not to be brought to bay by a single incursion carried out by heavy-armed troops, Dolabella summoned Ptolemy with his countrymen, and arranged four columns under the command of legates or tribunes; companies of raiders were led by picked Moors; he himself was present as adviser to all the divisions.
23)	25. “Before long, word came in that the Numidians had pitched their tents and were lying close by a half-ruined fort called Auzea, to which they had themselves set fire some time ago: they felt confident of their ground, as it was encircled by enormous woods. At this point, the light cohorts and mounted squadrons, without being informed of their destination, were hurried off at full speed. Day was just breaking when with a fierce yell and a blast of trumpets they came upon the half-awakened barbarians, while the Numidian horses were still shackled or straying through distant pasture-grounds. On the Roman side, the infantry were in massed formation, the cavalry disposed in troops, every provision made for battle: the enemy, in contrast, were aware of nothing, without weapons, without order, without a plan, dragged to slaughter or to captivity like cattle. The soldiers, embittered by the memory of hardships undergone and of battle so often hoped for against this elusive foe, took every man his fill of revenge and blood. Word was passed round the maniples that all were to make for Tacfarinas, a familiar figure after so many engagements: there would be no rest from war till the arch-rebel was slain. He, with his guards cut down around him, his son already in chains, and Romans streaming up on all hands, rushed on the spears and escaped captivity by a death which was not unavenged. This marked the close of hostilities.”
24)	And in AD 24 supported by Mauretaninas from the kingdom of Ptolemy, Publius Caornlius Dolabella finally defeated Tacfarinas at a fortress in a forest called Auzea. Tacfarinas committed suicide.
25)	1. Dolabella’s request for a military triumph was denied 26. “The request of Dolabella for triumphal distinctions was rejected by Tiberius: a tribute to Sejanus,* whose uncle Blaesus, might otherwise have found his glories growing dim. But the step brought no added fame to Blaesus, and the denial of the honor heightened the reputation of Dolabella, who, with a weaker army, had credited himself with prisoners of note, a general slain, and a war concluded.” (*Sejanus conspiracy has not yet been revealed and he was still a powerful Praetorian Prefect running things-mostly without Tiberius’ knowledge, in Rome). “Dolabella was attended also (a rare spectacle in Rome), by several Garamantian deputies, whom the tribesmen, awed by the fate of Tacfarinas and conscious of their delinquencies, had sent to offer satisfaction to the Roman people.” (Although he had no triumph, Dolabella had a deputation of Garamantians). 2. The Romans also acknowledged Ptolemy’s aid in the battle.* “Then, as the campaign had demonstrated Ptolemy’s good-will, an old-fashioned distinction was revived, and a member of the senate was dispatched to present him with the traditional bounty of the Fathers, an ivory scepter with the embroidered robe, and to greet him by the style of king, ally, and friend.”
26)	Thanksgiving inscriptions in Leptis Magna commemorate the defeat of Tacfarinas. Scipio was the leader of the sub-unit of the 9th Legion (seconded from Spain) 

Chapter 11: Caligula Lectures
11a. Introduction 
1)	Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus reigned from AD 37-41. He was born on 31 August AD 12 in Antium, the son of Germanicus and Agrippina I. He was the great grandson of Mark Antony, and as Germanicus’ son, the grandson of Agrippa; he also became Augustus’ great grandson, after the adoption of Germanicus by Tiberius. Gaius received the nickname Caligula from the legions on the Rhine, where his mother had taken him in AD 14. On 26 May in AD 17, he took part in his father’s triumph over Germania Magna, followed by a journey to the East when Germanicus was sent out to campaign in Syria and died; he and his mother and his siblings returned to Rome after the death of Germanicus on 10 October AD 19. Caligula was educated by his mother, then, after Tiberius exiled her, by his great grandmother Livia (whom he called a Ulysses in petticoats), and finally by his grandmother Antonia Minor, Germanicus’ mother. In 29, Caligula gave the funeral oration for Livia. In 31, Tiberius took Caligula to Campania, where the sources reveal he allegedly intrigued with Macro against Tiberius, his great uncle (10f).
2)	The Sources on Caligula are hostile Suetonius Life of Gaius Dio Roman History Book 59 Philo of Alexandria In Flaccum and Legatio ad Gaium. Josephus Jewish Antiquities (18.255-56; 19.1-211). Philo and Josephus underline Caligula’s abuses of Jewish populations; Caligula’s demands for recognition as a divinity almost caused the Jews to rebel. Tacitus’ account of Caligula’s reign is lost. There are sporadic references in Seneca (Dial. 2.18.1); his style was criticized by Caligula (Suet. Gaius 53. 2; Dio 59. 19.7-8). See Appendix below slides 18-19.
3)	Gaius, Tiberius’ successor was better known as Caligula or Little Boot. This nick-name was given to him as a child in Rhineland by the soldiers in his father, Germanicus’ legions. Suetonius 9
4)	His mother Agrippina I liked to dress him up as a little soldier with legionary uniform and little military boots, caligulae. Caligula or Little Boot. Toy legionary in caligulae, little military boots.
5)	After his father Germanicus’s death, Caligula, his mother ( Agrippina I) and brothers were persecuted by Sejanus. 
6)	Caligula was raised by his grandmother, Antonia Minor. When the conspiracy of Sejanus was uncovered, Caligula was swept off to Campania and lived with his great uncle Tiberius. Unlike Tiberius, Caligula had had no training for the throne when he was proclaimed in AD 37 (at age 25); he had held an honorary quaestorship in AD 33. He was popular with the legions, as Germanicus’ son. He also had the support of Macro, the praetorian prefect.
7)	Caligula was protected from Sejanus, who had launched prosecutions against the family of his father Germanicus but left him alone because he was too young to take the throne (at the time). Elected quaestor in 33, he was granted legal permission to apply for all offices and magistracies five years early as were imperial princes; he was designated to succeed Tiberius, with Gemellus (see 11c). Allegedly Caligula was involved in the death of Tiberius on 16 March AD 37 (Suet. Cal. 12; Tac. XII, 53). On the same day (16 March), the soldiers in Misenum acclaimed him as imperator; the Senate followed two days later. On 18 March Caligula assumed all of Tiberius’ titles, except pater patriae, (which he assumed later). On 28 March AD 37, Caligula entered Rome and was acclaimed by the Praetorian Guard. As emperor, Caligula was suffet (backup) consul from 1 July to 31 of August 37, consul in 39, in 40 (without a consular colleague), and in 41.
8)	II. Early Reign After the long, restrained and puritanical reign of Tiberius, the people welcomed Caligula because of his youth, his popularity with the armies and his generous provision of public entertainments and games (Suetonius 18).
9)	When Tiberius died (in AD 37) Caligula was poised to take the throne. Backed by the Praetorian Prefect (Macro), he accepted the powers of the Principate as conferred by the Senate, and he entered Rome. Caligula is shown on this coin, addressing the Praetorians. The Praetorians could make or break emperors; they would “break” Caligula.
10)	He ingratiated himself with people. He held lavish games. He distributed the legacies of Livia and Tiberius. He abolished the hated sales tax. He restored to the popular assemblies the right to elect magistrates; Tiberius had abolished Destinatio, which had been established by Augustus (Suet. 16; 18).
11)	This Coin is traditionally identified as celebrating the abolition of Tiberius’ sale tax by Caligula. Obverse: the liberty cap, which symbolizes the liberation of the people from the tax burden; it is bracketed by the letters SC (Senatus Consultum). The inscription on the reverse continues the emperor’s titles and surrounds the letters RCC. For many years, numismatists read this abbreviation as remissa ducentesima, and interpreted the legend as the remission (repeal) of the unpopular one-half percent sales tax (which is one part in two hundred) since CC is the Roman numeral for 200. A recent study (D. Woods, 2010) argues that this interpretation is unlikely, and RCC stands for res civium conservatae (the interests of citizens have been preserved).
12)	Senate At first Caligula courted the senate and deferred to it on all matters. He adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the nobility and the old aristocracy. He abolished all pending treason cases and curbed hated delatores.
13)	Many expected an improvement in the imperial court after the secretive, vindictive and gloomy court of Tiberius. These expectations were based on the memory of Caligula’s father Germanicus. Caligula perpetuated the memory of his family with public images, especially of Germanicus and Agrippina; his three sisters were also presented to the public and given the privileges of Vestal Virgins. In AD 37, Caligula abolished the charge of maiestas, or treason which Tiberius had so egregiously, abused, according to many historians of Rome, both ancient and modern.
14)	However, Caligula accomplished virtually nothing of significance and importance during his reign. Mercifully, he was only on the throne for four years, although his lack of experience and insight combined with his cruelty and narcissism led to some damage, and like most despots he made enemies and was distracted by conspiracies. His politics were based on arbitrary and erratic decisions, many of them repealed. After the first assassinations and promised repudiation of taxes, treason laws and informers, Caligula promoted conquest: he announced that he planned to invade and conquer Britain and reconquer the lands between the Rhine and the Elbe in Germania Magna that had been lost in the Varian disaster. Of course, these promised acta or deeds would not be realized or accomplished.
15)	Appendix: Lucius Annaeus Seneca (the Younger, Seneca Philosophus). Seneca’s career in the imperial court of the Julio-Claudians brought opportunities and abuses. It is a remarkable testimony to the disfunction, corruption and violence within the “family firm.” Seneca came from a prestigious and wealthy equestrian family in Corduba (province of Baetica Spain; Mart. 1,61,7) Seneca was educated in Rome (Epistles of Seneca. 108). From his youth he was prone to bronchial and pulmonary illness. At times, he contemplated suicide (Ep. 54, 1; 78, 1). Seneca’s maternal aunt who lived in Egypt, where her husband (C. Galerius) was prefect, promoted his career and presumably he spent some time there (Dialogues. 12,19,2). After her return, she helped him attain the quaestorship (Dial. 12,19,2). This was probably in the reign of Tiberius (before AD 37), when he was active in the trial courts as a lawyer. (Ep. 49,2). Caligula hated Seneca personally (Dio 59,18-19,7) and despised his writing style (Suet. Calig. 53, 2). He allegedly survived a death sentence imposed by Caligula, because he was so sickly, Caligula “reasoned” he would die in any case. Soon after the accession of Claudius (AD 41), Seneca was unwittingly involved in the conspiracy fabricated by Messalina, Claudius’ wife, who accused him of having committed adultery with Julia Livilla, the sister of Caligula and her (Messalina’s) new enemy and threat, Agrippina the Younger. Consequently, Seneca was condemned to death, but he was saved, and his sentence was commuted to banishment (relagatio), to Corsica. The seven and a half years he was in detention there were cruel (Sen. Dial. 11). His son and only child had died shortly before the verdict (Dial 12, 2, 5).
16)	Seneca’s banishment ended soon after the execution of Messalina (early in AD 49) and Claudius’ marriage to Agrippina II, who recalled him to Rome, gave him a praetorship and hired him to tutor to her young son Nero, Claudius’ future successor (Tac. Ann. 12, 8). From AD 54 to 62, Seneca acted as Nero’s advisor. Early in Nero’s reign, his mother Agrippina II ruled on Nero’s behalf. Seneca and the praetorian prefect, Burrus eventually opposed this “authoritarian matriarchy” which had become the cause of Nero’s bad behavior. That said, Seneca’s influence was strong in the first years of Nero’s reign (Tac. Ann. 13,2; Dio 61, 4, 1). He composed Nero’s accession speeches in which he promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate (Claudius had taken liberties with the courts). He also composed the eulogy for Claudius, which Nero gave at the funeral. Seneca’s satirical account the Apolocyntosis, making fun of the deification of Claudius and praising Nero, dates from the earliest period of Nero’s reign. Seneca drew up a program of “clemency” for Nero (Tac. Ann. 13, 11). The treatise, De clementia was intended to incentivize Nero to conform to the new rules, out of vanity and fear. All the while, Seneca was becoming a very rich man (growing an already sizeable fortune, based on opportunistic investments, business transactions and gifts (bribes?) from the imperial treasury, all of which attracted some envy and hatred (Tac. Ann 13, 42; 14, 52). After the death of Burrus (AD 62), the praetorian prefect who had managed to reign Nero in, Nero descended into tyranny and Seneca increasingly withdrew from the court (Tac. Ann. 14, 52-56; 15, 45). His end came with his implication (falsely) in the Pisonian conspiracy (Dio 62, 24,1) which led to his forced suicide (AD 65). Nero, with typical cruelty, prevented his second (?) wife, Pompeia Paulina, from following her husband to his death (Tac. Ann. 15, 60-64).
11b. Decline into tyranny, Gual 
1)	The (ancient) sources vary on the details and timeline, but they are unanimous that Caligula was insane, and agree that, at some point after suffering a serious illness in October of AD 37, Caligula emerged as a tyrant. Most modern historians also believe that this illness at the beginning of his reign, altered his mind and caused him, as the sources report, to become a cruel and deviant ruler. Suetonius Caligula 22 “So much for Caligula as emperor; we must now tell of his career as a monster.” Caligula became cruel, sadistic, self-absorbed, and delusional; he also ordered the execution of (Tiberius grandson), Gemellus, and finally he declared Tiberius’ will null and void on grounds (ironically) of insanity.
2)	G. Fagan “Caligula had been immensely popular. However, within four years he lay in a bloody heap in a palace corridor, murdered by officers of the very praetorian guard entrusted to protect him. The ancient sources are practically unanimous on the cause of Gaius’s downfall: he was insane. The ancient writers differ as to how this condition came about, but all agree that after his good start, Caligula began to behave in an openly autocratic manner, even a crazed one.”
3)	Suetonius reports Caligula fell ill within the first three months of his reign in October of AD 37 (Calig. 14.2) and places his descent into madness within a few months after the illness (37.3). “A few days after this, when he crossed to the islands near Campania, vows were put up for his safe return, while no one let slip even the slightest chance of giving testimony to his anxiety and regard for his safety. But when he fell ill, they all spent the whole night about the Palace; some even vowed to fight as gladiators, and others posted placards offering their lives, if the ailing prince were spared.”
4)	Suetonius (Caligula 50) refers to mental illness and epilepsy 1. “He was very tall and extremely pale, with an unshapely body, but very thin neck and legs. His eyes and temples were hollow, his forehead broad and grim, his hair thin and entirely gone on the top of his head, though his body was hairy. Because of this, to look upon him from a higher place as he passed by, or for any reason whatever, to mention a goat, was treated as a capital offence. While his face was naturally forbidding and ugly, he purposely made it even more savage, by practising all kinds of terrible and fearsome expressions before a mirror. 2. He was sound neither of body nor mind. As a boy he was troubled with the falling sickness,*and while in his youth he had some endurance, yet at times because of sudden faintness, he was hardly able to walk, to stand up, to collect his thoughts, or to hold up his head. He realised his mental infirmity and thought at times of going into retirement and clearing his brain. It is thought that his wife, Caesonia, gave him a drug intended for a love potion, which however had the effect of driving him mad. 3. He was especially tormented with sleeplessness; for he never rested more than three hours at night, and even for that length of time he did not sleep quietly, but rather was terrified by strange apparitions, once for example dreaming that the spirit of the Ocean talked with him. Therefore, weary of lying in bed wide awake during the greater part of the night, he would now sit upon his couch, and now wander through the long colonnades, crying out from time to time for daylight, and longing for its coming.”
5)	Suetonius reports the emperor had a history of epileptic; he also suspected that Caligula had a mental illness (Calig. 27. 2; 50. 2; 51.1). Cassius Dio described Caligula as mentally unstable (59. 4. 1; 59. 23. 4), and Tacitus stated that he suffered from a “disordered mind or intellect” ( Ann. 1 3. 3. 2). Philo of Alexandria suggested that Caligula’s illness in AD 37 contributed to his mental failings (Leg. 4. 22). According to Philo, Gaius was not corrupted until several months after he was on the throne. “But in the eighth month a serious illness attacked Gaius, who had exchanged the more moderate, and therefore healthier, mode of life which he had followed hitherto, during Tiberius’ lifetime, for a life of luxury” (Leg. 14). Suetonius however, states that it was Tiberius, who encouraged Caligula in deviant behaviors (Calig. 11). According to Josephus, Caligula’s madness did not begin until two years after his illness in AD 37 (AJ 18. 255-56; AJ. 19. 193). The sources agree Caligula’s illness concerned the people, who feared that if he died, civil war would be imminent (Philo Leg. 14-21; Dio 59. 8. 1),
6)	In sum, there is no clear evidence for what Caligula’s illness actually was, and when or if it sent him into a decline to tyranny. And from a historical perspective, the hostile tradition in the sources is based on a stereotype of Caligula as a madman, with the result that examples of his madness were simply inserted into the narrative to fit this stereotype. Madness was also a useful charge to explain an emperor’s autocracy and cruel treatment of those around him; e.g., Seneca believed that the paleness of Caligula’s complexion proved he was mad (Dial. 2.18.1). Sidwell:* “any easy resort to the ‘mad’ emperor solution simply ignores the more complex historiographical issues relating to the transmission of traditions concerning Caligula.”
7)	Medical studies of Caligula’s illness of October AD 37, agree that it was life threatening, but not necessarily the cause of his mental problems. They also agree that it is impossible to diagnose his mental state, given the fact that a diagnosis would require analysis of contemporary data. Most conclude that Caligula suffered from a personality disorder that caused dysfunction and manifested itself as autocratic behavior. This dysfunction may be related to his family history (think about his childhood: family killed by Sejanus; living with Tiberius). The personality disorder may or may not have been coupled with his alleged epilepsy and could also have caused psychological problems. Finally, medical historians agree that to characterize Caligula as insane is outdated, unacceptable in a modern analysis of a medical condition, and does not conform to pathological inquiry.
8)	Coin of Caligula with his sister portrayed as the three graces. The endless catalogue of Caligula’s madness reveals the historiographical problems relating to traditional narratives concerning Caligula: are they fact or fiction? Caligula forced the Senate to swear an oath of allegiance to him and to his sisters, with whom he engaged in incest. (Suet. 15; 24). He forced the senate to wait on him at his table dressed as slaves and even to kiss his feet (Suetonius 26)
9)	More Caligula stories: he imagined he conversed with gods. He planned to make his shores, Incitus a consul and made him high a priest of Jupiter cult. 
10)	Suetonius: 19, To counter a prediction that he would no more become emperor than ride across the Gulf of Baiae* with hoarse, in AD 39 Caligula constructed and artificial floating bridge of boats which he then crossed with a chariot. * Bay of Naples
11)	Turner 1831 Caligula’s Palace and Bridge, Caligula celebrated the completion of the bridge by riding across it in Alexander’s breast-plate 
12)	He had a temple to his cult constructed in Roman. Augusts and Tiberius had tolerated this in the east, but to construct a temple to one’s divine self in Rome was offensive. 
13)	The sources attribute Caligula’s interest in ruler cults to the fact that he was raised with Hellenistic princes: i. Three Thracian princes ii. Ptolemy of Mauretania iii. Herod Agrippa I of Judaea However, modern perspectives attribute Caligula’s autocratic impulses partly to a servile, accommodating and probably fearful senate (!)
14)	In terms of finances Caligula was reckless and excessive. He squandered surplus treasury money [Tiberius had left] and spent Livia’s legacy on drink, baths, horse races and lavish games and patronage gifts. At first the people found him generous and liked his flamboyance after the gloomy and penny-pinching Tiberius. But after squandering Tiberius’ money, Caligula resorted to imposing huge taxes, confiscations, and forced legacies. When he ran out of resources in Italy, he began looting Gaul.
15)	Between September of AD 39 and January of AD 40 Caligula conducted “campaigns” on the Rhine and in Gaul. Caligula also vowed to renew the campaigns in Germania Magna and to conquer Britain (!)
16)	Caligula went to Gaul in September of AD 39 (Dio 59. 21, 1), and he did not return to Rome again until his birthday, 31st August AD 40, when he celebrated an ovatio (Suet. Gaius 49, 2).* *fragment of the Acta Fratrum Arvalium suggests he was in Italy by Spring of AD 40
17)	During his tour of Gaul, Caligula went to Upper Germany (Moguntiacum) to execute Gn. Lentulus Gaetulicus and Aemilius Lepidus, (the husband of Caligula’s late sister, Drusilla), both of whom had organized a conspiracy to remove him from the throne (Dio 59. 22) in September of AD 39 (see 11c). Caligula also banished his surviving sisters, Livilla and Agrippina II, (the younger) whom he believed were implicated. Between December AD 39 and Jan./Feb. AD 40 Caligula went to Gallia Lugdunensis (Lugdunum) to confiscate wealth from provincial subjects. On his way home he took his “troops” to the edge of the English Channel, supposedly to carry out an invasion of Britain, but he changed his mind and returned to Rome.
18)	Cassius Dio 59. 21. 1-4 1. “Gaius had now spent practically all the money in Rome and the rest of Italy, gathered from every source from which he could in any way get it, and as no source of revenue in considerable amount or practicable to collect could be found there, and his expenses were pressing him hard, 2. he set out for Gaul, ostensibly because the hostile Germans were stirring up trouble, but in fact, with the purpose of exploiting both Gaul with its wealth, and Spain. He did not openly announce his expedition beforehand but went first to one of the suburbs and then suddenly set out on the journey, taking with him actors, gladiators, horses, women, and all trappings of luxury. 3. When he reached his destination, he did no harm to any of the enemy in fact, as soon as he had proceeded a short distance beyond the Rhine, he returned, and then set out as if to conduct a campaign against Britain, but turned back from the ocean's edge, showing no little vexation at his lieutenants who won some slight success, but on subject peoples, allies, and citizens he inflicted vast and innumerable ills. 4. In the first place, he despoiled those who possessed anything, on any and every excuse; and second, both private citizens and cities brought him large gifts voluntarily, as it was made to appear. He murdered some men on grounds that they were rebelling, and others on grounds they were conspiring against him; but the real complaint was the same for the whole people: the fact that they were rich.”
19)	Fake Campaigns Suetonius also writes about Caligula’s “campaign” in Gaul which came to nothing (Caligula 43-47). After his “military tour” of Gaul, in which he coerced civilians and his entourage to participate in mock skirmishes, he returned to Rome and tried to trump up a military triumph (which he gave up). Caligula forced his own bodyguards (slaves) and hostages (who had deserted from the legions) to dye their hair red, learn a few words of German, and pose as captured barbarians. 47. “Then turning his attention to his triumph, in addition to a few captives and deserters from the barbarians he chose all the tallest of the Gauls and as he expressed it, those who were worthy of a triumph, as well as some of the chiefs. These he reserved for his parade, and he forced them not only to dye their hair red and to let it grow long, but also to learn the language of the Germans and assume barbarian names.”
20)	Suetonius Caligula 46 on “campaigns” in Britain “Finally, as if he intended to bring the war to an end, he drew up a line of battle on the shore of the Ocean, arranging his ballistas and other artillery; and when no one knew or could imagine what he was going to do, he suddenly bade them to gather shells, and fill their helmets and the folds of their gowns, calling them ‘spoils from the Ocean, due to the Capitol and Palatine.’ As a monument of his victory, he erected a lofty tower, from which lights were to shine at night to guide the course of ships, as from the Pharos.*Then promising the soldiers a gratuity of one hundred denarii each, as if he had shown unprecedented liberality, he said, “Go your way happy; go your way rich.” Suetonius 49. 2 (his return to Rome) “He even forbade anyone of the senators to meet him. Then giving up or postponing his triumph, he entered the city on his birthday in an ovation; and within four months he perished, having dared great crimes and meditating still greater ones.” *Lighthouse at Alexandria
11c. Gemellus Conspiracy 
1)	Tiberius had made both Caligula and his cousin Gemellus (the surviving twin of Tiberius’ son Drusus II) joint and equal heirs in his will. To normalize the succession (ostensibly), immediately after Tiberius’ death Caligula adopted Gemellus. Caligula also allowed his uncle Claudius, (his own successor) to be his (suffet) consular colleague.
2)	Tiberius Julius Caesar Nero (Gemellus) was one of the twins born to Drusus II, the son of Tiberius, in the year of Germanicus’s death (AD 19). Gemellus’ twin brother died in infancy, but Gemellus (= Twin) continued to be his nickname; Gemellus’ father, Drusus II died under mysterious circumstances: he was allegedly murdered by Sejanus and Livilla (the wife of Drusus II), when Gemellus was only four years old. We don’t hear much about him after this, until his death. He received minimal official recognition from his grandfather, Tiberius, and he lived out his childhood in the shadow of his cousins Drusus and Nero, the unfortunate sons of Agrippina I. With the death of Germanicus’ family in the early 30’s, Gemellus, who was approaching majority, was made heir with Caligula to the throne by Tiberius. But Caligula appears to have been favored by Tiberius. In fact, Tiberius’ attitude toward his grandson in the years 31-37 was the subject of intense speculation among the ancients.
3)	Obverse: Confronting heads of two little boys the twin sons of Drusus II, Tiberius Gemellus and Tiberius Germanicus, born in AD 19. Their busts rest on crossed cornucopiae, with a caduceus between them, symbolizing good fortune and long life. This coin type was issued by Tiberius, the twins’ grandfather to celebrate their birth.
4)	Tacitus (Ann. 6.46) implies Tiberius promoted Gemellus because he was his natural grandson, although he was also aware of his youth and inevitable vulnerability after his own (Tiberius’) death. Josephus (AJ 18.205-14, 218-222) reports Tiberius planned to name as successor whichever of his descendants his grandson, Gemellus or his great nephew Caligula, approached him first to declare his position. Caligula, showed up first and Tiberius, who was aware of Gemellus’ weaker position by virtue of his age, begged him to spare his grandson. Philo (Leg. 23-25) presents Tiberius as favoring Gemellus and planning his succession, but dying before he could ratify it. Suetonius (Tib. 62.3) declares that Tiberius hated Gemellus because he was the result of adultery between Sejanus and Livilla. Cassius Dio (58. 23. 2-4) reports Tiberius determined that Caligula would succeed him, since he was older than Gemellus and because as Suetonius notes, Tiberius harbored doubts about Gemellus’ genealogy, a reasonable assumption, given the circumstances of his birth. Dio also adds Tiberius was certain Gemellus would be killed but did nothing to help him.
5)	When Tiberius died (16 March, 37), Caligula came to power with the support of the Praetorian Prefect, (Sutorius) Macro. When Tiberius’ will was read- out in the senate, to everyone’s surprise, Gemellus had been designated as co-heir with Caligula. (Suet. Tib. 76. Philo (Leg.25, 28-29); Dio (59.1.1) interprets this act as a clear sign that Tiberius intended for Gemellus to succeed him with Caligula. The promotion of Gemellus as co-heir cost him his life. Caligula moved swiftly to negate the threat he believed his younger cousin presented. He had Tiberius’ will nullified (on what legal basis is unknown) but he pretended to promote him as his colleague. Caligula adopted Gemellus as his son, and had him declared princeps iuventutis, first among youths, and head of the imperial youth guild, a quasi-political appointment reserved for favored princes in line to succeed reigning emperors. However, by the end of the year (AD 37) or early in 38, Caligula ordered Gemellus to be murdered. (Philo Leg. 26-28 30-31); Suet. Gaius 15.2, 23.3; Dio 59.8.1; Jos. AJ 18.223.
6)	So, there are some inconsistencies in the sources, but the general idea is that Tiberius had doubts, but named Gemellus as heir or planned to do. After Tiberius death, allegedly, at the instigation of the praetorian prefect Macro, his testament (will) was suppressed; in addition, Gemellus was excluded from the succession and executed at the end of 37 or early in 38. (Suet. Gaius 15.2, 23.3; Dio 59, 1, 2 59.8.1; Suet. Cal. 14, 1; 23 Jos. AJ 18. 223; Philo Leg. 26-28; 59-61.) This was evidently the first murder committed by Caligula after he had “recovered” from his illness; the sources give us a long list of the victims of Caligula’s illness; Gemellus was among them, and the first to be reported. The question arises, was his murder prompted by Caligula’s illness and apparent paranoia or was it prompted by a reasonable fear (fueled by his illness and paranoia) of a real conspiracy, in which Gemellus was involved, to eliminate Caligula?
7)	Suetonius Caligula 23: Abuse by Caligula of his family and death of Gemellus “Because of Agrippa’s humble origin, Caligula loathed being described as his grandson and would fly into a rage if anyone mentioned him, in speech or song, as an ancestor of the Caesars. He nursed a fantasy that his mother had been born of an incestuous union between Augustus and his daughter Julia; and not content with thus discrediting Augustus' name, Caligula cancelled the annual commemorations of Agrippa’s victories at Actium and off Sicily, declaring that they had proved the disastrous ruin of the Roman people. He called his great-grandmother Livia a “Ulysses in petticoats,” and in a letter to the Senate dared describe her as of low birth, “her maternal grandfather Aufidius Lurco having been a mere local senator at Fundi” though the public records showed Lurco to have held high office at Rome. When his grandmother Antonia asked him to grant her a private audience, he insisted on taking Macro, the Praetorian Guards’ Commander, as his escort. Unkind treatment of this sort hurried her to the grave though, according to some, he accelerated the process with poison and, when she died, showed so little respect that he sat in his dining-room and watched the funeral pyre burn. One day he sent a colonel to kill young Tiberius Gemellus without warning; on the pretext that Gemellus had insulted him by taking an antidote against poison - his breath smelled of it. Then he forced his father-in-law, Marcus Silanus, to cut his own throat with a razor, the charge being that he had not followed the imperial ship when it put to sea in a storm but had stayed on shore to seize power at Rome if anything happened to himself. The truth was that Silanus, a notoriously bad sailor, could not face the voyage; and Gemellus’ breath smelled of medicine taken for a persistent cough which was getting worse. Gaius preserved his uncle Claudius merely as a butt for practical jokes.”
8)	The short life and violent death of Gemellus at the hands of his cousin Caligula reveals how the irregular legal position of Julio-Claudian princes and arbitrary procedures of designating imperial successors could lead to deadly competition and treachery within the (family) firm, that was fatal for many members of the Julio-Claudian family. As mentioned, the murder of Gemellus was the first crime committed by Caligula after his illness. And Gemellus was the first of Caligula’s victims mentioned in the sources. Dio reports that the charge made against Gemellus by Caligula late in 37 (or early in 38) was that Gemellus had anticipated Caligula’s death and had waited for a chance to benefit from his illness. Philo reports that the Caligula accused the young boy of implication in a conspiracy. Suetonius claims that Gemellus had a chronic and deteriorating cough, for which he took medicine; when Caligula detected the smell on his breath, he accused Gemellus of taking an antidote against poison, the inference being that Gemellus was anticipating that Caligula would try to kill him.
9)	Soldiers were sent to order Gemellus to take his own life (imperials could not be murdered when they needed to go, so they were forced to take their lives). As Philo reports, when, “pathetically, the lad was handed the sword he did not know what to do with it and had to be helped” to quote Barret (see below) Dio adds that in Gemellus’ case no reference was made by Caligula to the senate (59. 8. 2). The comment that no reference was made to the senate is consistent with Suetonius’ description of the circumstances of his death (“without warning.”) An apparent sign of the hatred that Caligula felt for Gemellus at the time of his death is the fact he (Gemellus) is not recorded as his (Caligula’s) adopted son on his (Gemellus) gravestone, buried near the Mausoleum of Augustus: he is just mentioned as Drusus’ (II) son: Ti. Caesar Drusi Caesaris f(ilius) hic situs est (‘here lies Tiberius Caesar, son of Drusus Caesar).
10)	Philo of Alexandria (V. 30-31) gives the most detailed and heart-breaking account of Gemellus’ death: “The young man was ordered to commit suicide under supervision and had to be guided through it by a centurion and legate,* both more skilled in killing than him.” *his is named as “a captain of a thousand” meaning a legionary legate or a captain of a cavalry unit.
11)	Philo of Alexandria Legatio ad Gaius V 30-31: (30) “It is said moreover, that this youth, being ordered to slay himself with his own hands, while a centurion and a captain of a thousand were standing by (who had been expressly commanded to take no part in the horrid deed, since it was not lawful for the descendants of the emperors to be put to death by any one else; for Caligula remembered the laws amid his lawless acts, and had some regard for piety in all his impious deeds, imitating as well as he could the nature of truth). Gemellus, not knowing how to kill himself, for he had never seen anyone else put to death, and had never had any practice in fighting with weapons, which is the usual exercise and course of instruction for children who are being educated with a view to become leaders and rulers, on account of the wars which they may have to conduct, at first exhorted those officers who had come to him to put him to death themselves, stretching out his neck. (31) But when they did not dare to do so, he himself taking the sword inquired in his ignorance and want of experience what was the most mortal place, in order that by a well-directed blow he might cut short his miserable life; and they, like instructors in misery, led him on his way, and pointed out to him the part into which he was to thrust his sword; and he, having thus learnt his first and last lesson, became miserable that he was, his own murderer under compulsion.”
12)	Was there a Conspiracy of Gemellus? Antony Barret has argued (1993, 74-78) that the references in the sources to Gemellus having taken an antidote against (being poisoned by) the emperor (antidotum adversus Caesarem) may suggest that he was indeed involved in a conspiracy to remove Caligula. This may be supported by Cassius Dio’s observation that Gemellus was charged for having “prayed for and anticipated Caligula’s death.”
13)	The following text (slides 16-18) is from Anthony Barret, Caligula: The Corruption of Power “We have only the barest outline of events for the period, and it is easy to forget that during the illness the day-to-day operation of the state would have had to continue. The chief executives would have been the consuls, who could have represented the concerns of the princeps, Caligula in dealing with the senate. But there were many tasks whose terms of reference would not have been so clearly established by precedent. These would have ranged from formal ceremonies, like receiving deputations, to such routines as giving the password to the imperial guard. The presence of the princeps was also expected at games, the theatre and festivals. It would have been almost inevitable that Gemellus, as the emperor’s (adopted) son, should have represented him at other non-political events. Caligula had been treated as one upon whose shoulders the fate of the Roman world rested. Upon recovering from his illness, he would have discovered the disconcerting truth that no one is indispensable and that things had gone ahead no less smoothly than before.”
14)	“The resentment that this would have engendered, along with the natural suspicion of plots and conspiracies endemic to the age, might have made it difficult for him to accept that Gemellus’ conduct during his illness had been dictated by circumstances and not by ambition.” “It also might have been difficult for him to interpret any support that Gemellus received during this period other than as disloyalty. This might explain Dio’s cryptic comment (59, 10. 8.) that several people owed their destruction to Caligula’s illness.” “The situation would have been aggravated by Gemellus’ delicate position. To the extent that Augustus and Tiberius had laid down any sort of pattern for the succession, the only possible candidate during the serious illness (of Caligula) would have been Gemellus.” “Admittedly he was far from being the ideal successor, for his age and lack of experience would have told strongly against him. The senate had apparently shown no reluctance in removing him from the succession, and if there were any proGemellus (political) party in that body, it must have been small and not very vocal.”
15)	“Despite this, however, he would still, as the emperor’s son, have been seen as the inevitable candidate. This, of course, is no more than speculation. It could well be that Caligula’s suspicions were well-grounded, and that Gemellus was at the center of an embryonic conspiracy. Even Philo suggests that in a sense it was a good thing that Gemellus died because the empire was impossible to share, and people were beginning to take sides (Philo Leg. 68). When we are told that early in the reign Caligula refused to give an ear to evidence of a plot, we may have been given the public face that he put on the approach to him. In fact, he may have taken the information seriously. While Gemellus’ death does seem to foreshadow the rift between Caligula and the senate that would follow later, it is to be noted that Philo admits that the public did not criticize Caligula for this and the other executions that immediately followed his illness.”
11d. Foreign policy and conspiracies 
1)	Caligula’s policies in Africa: the first phase of the annexation of Mauretania
2)	Caligula’s attempt to incorporate (annex) Mauretania led to a serious rebellion in western North Africa in AD 41. The summaries of the missing chapters in Dio (55-60) suggest that it was Caligula (rather than Claudius) who undertook the process of annexing Mauretania; Claudius completed it. The decision to annex the kingdom of Mauretania as two provinces was based on legitimate strategic grounds: 1. The rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed the province of Africa Proconsularis was to the unromanized, western territories and their indigenous tribes, which were increasingly difficult to control on account of Tiberian policies of military intervention, aimed at making these populations sedentary. 2. The weakness of king Juba II and his son, king Ptolemy of Mauretania demonstrated that the Romans could no longer depend on indigenous vassal kings and princes to protect Roman assets in North Africa.
3)	In order to implement this policy, Caligula effectively militarized Africa Proconsularis by changing the command structure. He made it into a hybrid combination of an Imperial and a Senatorial Province. Caligula gave control of the 3rd Legion and a military governorship to an equestrian prefect,*who administered the less stable western regions (Numidia and western Africa Proconsularis). The proconsul (governor of Africa Proconsularis) with only one cohort now, administered the district around Carthage and was the subordinate of the military governor: the prefect outranked the proconsul. *After Nero, the military governor and commander of the 3rd legion was called a Legate and generally was chosen from the senatorial class.
4)	Caligula’s African policy: Predictably the sources explain Caligula’s militarization of Africa in terms of his personal (arbitrary) shortcomings: specifically, his fear and paranoia of the new proconsul for political reasons. However recent appraisals of the reign agree that the decision to annex Mauretania was based on legitimate strategic grounds. The rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how vulnerable and exposed Africa Proconsularis was to western populations and adversaries. The weak performance of the Mauretanian vassal king Ptolemy and his father Juba II had shown how unreliable they were as stewards (or protectors) of Africa, and its Roman colonies and assets in Mauretania.
5)	Ptolemy of Mauretania; Ptolemy of Mauretania, like his father Juba II, was unable to control his subjects, who continued to be disruptive. In AD 39 Caligula summoned him to Rome, and in the winter of 40 he executed him; the execution of Ptolemy raises many questions. Caligula’s aggressive policies in western Africa would have been met with resistance by Ptolemy’s court in Mauretania, however such resistance would not have prompted Ptolemy’s murder even by Caligula.
6)	What was Ptolemy's Crime? Fishwick: Ptolemy may have been involved in a conspiracy to depose Caligula because of his Roman policies in Africa. Caligula's military intervention in Mauretania may have induced Ptolemy to join the conspiracy of Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus, legate of Upper Germany, who had plotted to kill Caligula in 39. The conspirators included M. Lepidus the husband of Caligula's sister (see below)
7)	D. Fishwick has argued that Gaetulicus and Ptolemy were friends, and that the friendship might have brought Ptolemy into the plot. Gaetulicus’ father had campaigned with Ptolemy’s father, Juba II. Ptolemy might also have been induced to join by the promise of an independent kingdom, i.e., he may have been planning to seize the independence of Mauretania from Rome. Bad blood between Ptolemy's freedmen and those of Caligula (Pliny) may also have provoked hostilities; Pliny (NH 5.1) reports that after Ptolemy’s death a revolt broke out under Aedemon, one of his freedmen. “The Roman arms, for the first time, pursued their conquests into Mauritania, under the Emperor Claudius,* when the freedman Ædemon took up arms to avenge the death of King Ptolemy, who had been put to death by Caligula; and it is a well-known fact, that on the flight of the barbarians our troops reached Mount Atlas.”
8)	Widespread rebellion against Roman authority in North Africa is attested in the archaeological record, e.g., part of Volubilis was destroyed by fire. The southwest area of the forum at Lixus was also burnt to the ground, pillaged and abandoned by the population. Finally, a gap in the numismatic sequence after the last coins of Ptolemy suggests that the destruction came immediately after the end of his reign.
9)	The Eastern Mediterranean Caligula’s “policies” in the east were damaging to Rome. He reorganized client kingdoms in the east to reward his friends. For the three Thracian princes, with whom he had been raised, Caligula found kingdoms in: Lesser Armenia, Pontus and part of Thrace. Caligula gave the territories in Judaea ruled by the Herodian vassal king, Phillip Herod II to Herod Agrippa I, Phillip’s nephew. Herod Agrippa I was a friend of Caligula, having been raised in Rome in the Julio-Claudian court. Caligula simply dethroned Philip Herod of his territory, known as the Tetrarchy of Philip, and gave it to Herod Agripppa I (see 12b, 6; 12f, 8).
10)	Caligula dethroned and recalled the Roman-friendly ruler of the Kingdom Armenia, Mithridates, possibly as part of a bargain with the Parthian king Artabenes, in return for Parthian recognition of Roman interests in the east. He did not replace him, and thus broke with a long-standing Augustan policy of keeping a Roman friendly-king on the Armenian throne. This created a vacuum, into which the Parthians were drawn. Finally, and typically, Commagene, the little kingdom which Tiberius had annexed as a province, was restored to the son of its former king, as a bribe.
11)	Conspiracies and Family (Dio 59.22) With the exception of Gaetulicus, Ptolemy and Macro, among the emperor’s victims were his family: his father-in-law, M. Junius Silanus, his cousin, Gemellus, his surviving sisters, and finally Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Lepidus, the husband of Caligula’s late sister, Drusilla, the oldest and his favorite, was also implicated in the conspiracy of Gaetulicus, and executed.
12)	In AD 39 the legate of Upper Germany, Gnaeus Lentulus Gaetulicus conspired to place Aemilius Lepidus, the widower of Caligula’s late sister, Drusilla on the throne. As noted, it has been argued that king Ptolemy of Mauretania was also implicated in the conspiracy, consequently recalled to Rome and murdered by Caligula in AD 40. The conspiracy was uncovered in eastern Gaul, while Caligula was visiting the area during his campaigns to “reconquer ” Germany. Both Gaetulicus and Lepidus were found out and executed. The surviving sisters, Livilla and Agrippina II were banished and subjected to incessant accusations of impieties by Caligula. The following reference to Lepidus in Dio reveals that he also suffered similar abuse, posthumously.
13)	Cassius Dio 59.22: Elimination of Lepidus and Gaetulicus; banishment of sisters. 5. “As for the others who perished, there is no need of my naming over most of them, but I will mention those of whom history requires some record. In the first place, then, he put to death Lentulus Gaetulicus, who had an excellent reputation in every way and had been governor of (upper) Germany for ten years, for the reason that he was endeared to the soldiers. 6. Another of his victims was Lepidus, that lover and favorite of his, the husband of Drusilla, the man who had together with Gaius maintained improper relations with the emperor’s other sisters, Agrippina and Julia, the man whom he had allowed to stand for office five years earlier than was permitted by law; 7. and whom he kept declaring he would leave as his successor to the throne. To celebrate this man’s death, he gave the soldiers money, as though he had defeated some enemies, and sent three daggers to Mars Ultor in Rome. 8. He deported his sisters to the Pontian Islands because of their relations with Lepidus, having first accused them in a communication to the senate of many impious and immoral actions. Agrippina was given Lepidus’ bones in an urn and bidden to carry it back to Rome, keeping it in her bosom during the whole journey. 9. Also, since many honors had been voted earlier to his sisters manifestly on his act, he forbade the awarding of other distinctions to any of his relatives.”
14)	Abusive policies toward Jewish Subjects Caligula was reckless, inconsistent and disrespectful to the Jewish populations in Alexandria and Judaea. Philo of Alexandria wrote about the delegation that went to Rome to complain about the abuses sanctioned and committed by the emperor Philo, Embassy to Gaius (XLIX 349- XLV 67)
15)	AD 39 Judeo-pagan Conflict A Jewish embassy under the leadership of the philosopher, Philo of Alexandria, went to Rome to petition Caligula about abuses committed by the Greeks of Alexandria, which the emperor had sanctioned. Caligula had also ordered a gold statue of himself to be placed in the Temple of Jerusalem, to punish the population of Yavneh (ca. 65 k to west) which had dared to destroy an altar of the cult of the emperor, set up in that city by its Greek minority. Finally Jewish populations were offended by Caligula’s insistence that they worship the cult of the emperor, an obligation from which they were normally exempt, although its enforcement by the Romans was arbitrary.
16)	In his Embassy to Gaius, (Legatio ad Gaium)* Philo gives an account of the misadventures of the delegation: Fifteen months of waiting in Rome for Caligula to condescend to receive them, an ordeal made even more unbearable by the emperor’s progressive “madness.” The interview bordered on the ridiculous, and it was impossible to pursue a serious discussion of the political claims of the petitioners and their legal foundation. Caligula finally calmed down. Philo wrote: “He became gentler and merely said, ‘I think that these men are not so much criminals, as lunatics in not believing that I have been given a divine nature.’ And with that he left us and told us to go away too.” *As we have seen he also excoriates Caligula and writes in detail about his cruelty.
17)	Family devotion That said, Caligula was devoted* to his late brother, Nero, and his mother, Agrippina I. Caligula found their ashes where they had been held as prisoners. Tiberius cruelly, had hidden them. Caligula placed their ashes in the imperial mausoleum (Suet. 15).
18)	Suetonius: Gaius 15 (Gaius/Caligula made an ostentatious, public display of piety for mother and brother). “Gaius himself tried to rouse men’s devotion by courting popularity in every way. After eulogising Tiberius with many tears before the assembled people and giving him a magnificent funeral, he at once posted off to Pandateria and the Pontian islands, to remove the ashes of his mother and brother to Rome; and in stormy weather, too, to make his filial piety the more conspicuous. He approached them with reverence and placed them in the urn with his own hands. With no less theatrical effect he brought them to Ostia in a bireme with a banner set in the stern, and from there up the Tiber to Rome, where he had them carried to the Mausoleum on two biers by the most distinguished men of the order of knights, in the middle of the day, when the streets were crowded. He appointed funeral sacrifices, too, to be offered each year with due ceremony, as well as games in the Circus in honor of his mother, providing a carriage to carry her image in the procession.”
11e. Wives of Caligula 
1)	It has been argued (Wardle 1998) that Suetonius’ biography of Caligula is distinguished from his other biographies of emperors in its inclusion of sexual material about Caligula throughout his accounts of his life. Marriage, adultery, homosexuality, and incest, all are prominent in both the chronological and thematic sections of the work as predictable tropes to characterize him as immoral and flawed. As we have seen, Suetonius believed Caligula was insane. It has also been suggested that analysis of the ancient tradition on Caligula’s marriages may provide clues about how the marriages were impacted by his illness and how they impacted his behavior.
2)	Suetonius’ analysis of the reign of Caligula is organized under various categories which include thematic criteria, organized by topic. However, his reign is also divided into two parts, by separating the actions of a princeps from those of a monster; this format follows a standard arrangement of “a good part versus a bad part” of an emperor’s reign wherein the reign starts out well, but then declines into a tyranny. This was used by ancient historians for Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. Caligula’s marriages fall into the second (monster) category and are discussed by Suetonius under the general heading of “impiety and irreverence.”
3)	Junia Claudia
a)	Junia Claudia was married to Caligula before he was elevated to the throne in 33 (Tac. Ann. 6. 20.1); Dio 58.25.2 locates it at Antium and dates the wedding to 35; Suet. (Cal. 12.1) calls her Junia Claudilla and dates the wedding to 31. Junia’s father Marcus Junius Silanus, Caligula’s father-in-law belonged to a family that was prominent under the Julio-Claudians. Tiberius held him in such high regard that he refused to try any case on appeal from his decision; Junia probably joined Caligula when he returned to Capri (Campania), to an atmosphere of increasing intrigue, as Tiberius was dying, and the matter of the succession was imminent. Tiberius’ Praetorian prefect Macro, who allegedly smothered him to death in his bedclothes, had by now decided that Caligula would soon be elevated to the throne; he tried to ingratiate himself with Caligula and press his case with Tiberius. To this end he even exploited a personal tragedy of Junia and Caligula:
b)	 In 34/36 Junia became pregnant; neither she nor the infant survived the birth (Suet. Cal. 12.2). Tacitus and Dio claimed that after Junia’s death Macro convinced his wife Ennia, to have an affair with Caligula, to curry favor with him, while Caligula was happy to go along with the scheme, since he realized that Macro’s support would benefit him. Suetonius even claims that Caligula planned to marry her if he became emperor, swearing to it on oath, and confirming the promise with a written contract (Tac. Ann. 6.45.5; 58.28.4). Philo (Leg. 39, 61) places the blame on Ennia, suggesting she deceived Macro, who had no idea of the affair, while Suet. (Cal. 12. 2) blames Caligula, claiming that he seduced Ennia. In any case, when Caligula later decided to get rid of Macro, he charged Macro with procuring or pandering (lenocinium, i.e., pimping his wife to Caligula, (which was a crime, thanks to the Augustan morals laws).
c)	The death of Marcus Junius Silanus (the father of Caligula’s first wife) Tacitus reports that in November or December of 37, Caligula had Junia Claudia’s father, Marcus Junius Silanus executed for unclear reasons. This would be at about the same time as Gemellus’ execution or just before it. Suetonius claims he (Silanus) might have been plotting against Caligula (23. 3). Philo (Leg. 62-5) and Dio (59. 8. 5) claim the emperor was just annoyed by him. There appears to be no link between the execution of Gemellus and Caligula’s father-in-law, Silanus. As mentioned, Tiberius had held Silanus in great esteem and even gave him the rank of princeps senatus, normally reserved for emperors. The sources are silent about what might have led to Silanus’ fall from grace and his death. Only Suetonius reports that when Caligula sailed to Pontia and Pandateria to recover the remains of his mother and brother, Silanus refused to accompany him because, he said, he was prone to seasickness, and that Caligula typically suspected that he had stayed behind to take over, if Caligula himself should be lost at sea.
d)	Tacitus observes that Julius Graecinus, the father of his (Tacitus’) father-in law, Agricola, was forced to commit suicide for refusing to prosecute M. Junius Silanus. If this is the same Silanus, it suggests that Silanus faced some sort of charge and trial. The story about Silanus’ plotting while Caligula was at sea may just be a mixed-up conflation of one of the charges that Silanus might have been involved in, with the supposed conspiracy of Gemellus, to replace Caligula with Gemellus. Whatever the political or legal background, Silanus’ downfall and death is not disputed: he committed suicide with his own razor in AD 37. Caligula’s suspicion may have prompted him to think more seriously about the issue of his succession and the matter of heirs, or children. For at some point just before the end of 37 Caligula remarried. His new wife’s name is uncertain, but she is generally called Livia Orestilla. At the time of her marriage, she was already engaged to Gaius Calpurnius Piso,*from a family that was still powerful and distinguished in Rome. Piso’s admission into the Arval brotherhood in place of Silanus on 24 May in 38 may have been a reward for his consent in the marriage, by divorcing Orestilla who was at the time his wife ( Suet. Cal. 25.1; Dio 59.8.7). * who was behind a major conspiracy against the emperor Nero (see 13f 2-20).
4)	Livia Orestilla
a)	 Thus, Caligula forced or incentivized Piso to annul the marriage to Orestilla so he could marry her. Dio and Suetonius report that this occurred during the wedding celebrations of Piso and Orestilla. Suetonius claims Caligula issued a proclamation the next day that he had acquired a new wife in the tradition of Romulus and Augustus, referring to the fact that they had both seized their brides from their original husbands (Livia had been married to T. C. Nero (see 7e), and Hersilia had been married to Hersilius).
b)	 Orestilla was a reluctant wife and she remained loyal to Piso. Caligula in any case got sick of her and divorced her. This happened after a few days, according to Suetonius, who adds that Caligula eventually banished her on the grounds that she had taken up with Piso again within two years after their marriage. Caligula placed a restrictive period on his wives before they were allowed to remarry. Dio incorrectly* places the banishment after two months, adding that Piso was also banished. In fact, Piso was still in Rome until June of AD 40.
5)	Lollia Paulina 
a)	 After his divorce from Orestilla Caligula did not marry immediately. According to the sources “he sought solace with his sister Drusilla;” of course typically, incest was levelled against Caligula to demonize and defame him. Only after Drusilla’s death on June 10th of 38 did Caligula marry again. While not supporting the allegations of incest, this story does reveal the closeness of his relationship with Drusilla. After honoring Drusilla and divinizing her, Caligula remarried at the end of September or the beginning of October of AD 38. According to Suetonius (Cal. 25.2), Caligula chose Lollia as his third wife because her grandmother had been very beautiful, the inference from Suetonius being that Caligula had never seen her before he summoned her from Greece; but he adds he may also have been motivated by an increasingly difficult financial horizon: she was a woman of a plebian family with great inherited wealth. Caligula was attracted by her money as well as her powerful political connections to the Julio-Claudians.
b)	 Barret: “Pliny the Elder ( NH 9.117) saw her at a dinner party, covered with emeralds and interlaced pearls over her head, neck and fingers, the total amounting to 40 million sesterces. For those who doubted that such wealth could belong to one woman, she reputedly carried the proof of ownership on her person. Pliny was unimpressed by her conspicuous consumption, especially because she told everyone at the party that the jewelry cost the equivalent of a year’s wages for 40,000 Roman soldiers.”
c)	 In addition, Lollia Paulina was already married. Her husband, Publius Memmius Regulus, was from a humble provincial family, and as suffect consul in 31, the year of Sejanus’ downfall, Regulus had been involved in the overthrow of Sejanus (10e, 2). At the time of Caligula’s wedding, Regulus was governor of Moesia, Macedonia, and Achaea, to which he was appointed in AD 35 and where he would stay until 44. Suetonius says that Memmius was called from his province to participate in the ceremony; Dio adds the interesting detail that Caligula forced Memmius to divorce his wife and personally give her away in marriage like the best man (this arrangement recalls Livia’s being given away by her first husband T. C. Nero, to Octavian in return for his (T. C. Nero’s) political restoration in Rome (7e). The sources are confusing, inconsistent and unclear about when Caligula divorced Paulina and remarried. Both Suetonius and Cassius Dio claim that the divorce from Lollia followed very soon after the marriage, which probably occurred in October of 38. Dio places the divorce of Lollia just before Caligula’s next and final marriage, to Caesonia, which occurred in the Spring of 39.
d)	 As to the matter of why Caligula divorced Lollia, Dio states Caligula got rid of her on the pretext that she was barren, but that in fact, he was tired of her. It is worth noting in this context, that according to Tacitus, she was allegedly barren, and thus had been considered by the widowed* emperor Claudius as a prospective wife and stepmother for his children and heirs, because since she was barren, she would not present a threat to the succession (Dio 59. 23.7; Tac. Ann. 12.2.2). If this is true, it supports Dio’s date of before spring of AD 39 for the divorce, not long after Caligula’s mistress (Caesonia, who would become his fourth wife) had become pregnant. Suetonius states that Caligula absurdly forbade Lollia from ever sleeping with another man, presumably to avoid the danger that if she had children, any charges of infertility might be levelled at Caligula (Suet. Cal. 25.2). On the other hand, Caligula’s first wife was pregnant at the time of her death and his fourth wife gave birth to his child just before their marriage. So, he had no reason to fear doubts about his ability to produce heirs. And as noted, he imposed similar restrictions on his second wife; it is possible that the reference refers to some restrictive period he placed on all his wives before he would allow them to remarry. *the participial adjective “widowed” is used for women and men.
6)	Milonia Caesonia
a)	 Milonia Caesonia was Caligula’s fourth and last wife from 39 until they were both assassinated in 41. She was from an obscure plebeian family
b)	 Caligula found “his soulmate” in his fourth and final wife, Caesonia. She was the daughter of Vistilia, a woman married six times; Vstilia’s multiple pregnancies are mentioned by Pliny (Natural History). One of her relatives was probably the Vistilia who registered as a public prostitute, to avoid a prosecution for adultery. Nothing is known about her father Caesonius Milonius. Caesonia was born of his sixth marriage. Suetonius says she was not beautiful, or young, and had a reputation for “high living and low morals.” She had also already had three daughters. She was probably born in ca. AD 5 and so she was seven years older than Caligula, which was unusual in Roman times (Jos. AJ 19, 193; Tac. Ann. 2. 85. 1-4; Pliny NH 7. 39; Suet. Cal. 25.34, 33; Dio 59.23.7, 28.7).
c)	 Caesonia’ portrait appears on this coin of Herod Agrippa I. Depictions of Caligula on Agrippa’s coins are relatively realistic; following this practice, Caesonia’s portrait is severe and stern; she also looks older than Caligula. Mint: Caesaria Paenas - Judaea AD 40/41 Obverse: ΚΑΙΣΩΝΙΑ ΓΥΝΗ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΥ: obverse draped bust of Caesonia facing left; “Caesonia wife of Augustus
d)	 According to Suetonius, Caligula was so proud of Caesonia that he allegedly showed her off nude to his friends and paraded her (nude but for cloak, helmet and shield) to the soldiers. Suetonius adds that as a demonstration of his affection, Caligula would jokingly threaten to have her tortured or killed. These are obviously the types of defamatory tropes that writers offered about Caligula. Caligula’s friends could not understand her appeal and spread the story that she had snared him with a love potion, which Juvenal wrote, led to Caligula's madness.
e)	 The fact that Caesonia had borne three daughters already might have been a positive recommendation, since it would have shown that she was fertile. Dio reports the two were lovers before their marriage, and that Caesonia was quite pregnant when he married her; according to Suetonius the marriage took place on the day of her daughter’s birth (Dio says a month before). Caligula was devoted to their daughter, whom he named Julia Drusilla after his late sister. When she was born, Caligula carried her to the Capitoline temple, and placed her on Jupiter’s knee (to establish her paternity, according to Dio and Josephus), then on Minerva’s knee, assigning her education to Minerva. “Caligula may have spoiled her, as she seems to have developed a savage temper, once viciously scratching the eyes of her playmates, which her father humorously cited as absolute proof of her paternity.” Barret (Suet. Aug. 94. 8. Suet. Cal. 25. 4)
11f. Assassination  
1)	ASSASSINATION On 24 January AD 41 Caligula was slain at the Palatine games by Cassius Chaerea, a tribune in the Praetorian Guard. Chaerea and the praetorians were backed by the senate and the armies.
2)	The later part of AD 39 was marked by plots and treachery. Problems between Caligula and the senate came to a head in September when Caligula removed the consuls from office because they had failed to order a thanksgiving for his birthday and he had found the races and annual shows insufficient; in addition, he banned the victory games for Actium and Sicily, because the victories had been disastrous for the Roman people. Finally he may have suspected a conspiracy (Suet. Cal. 23. 1, 26. 3; Dio 59. 20. 1). For Caligula felt threatened from several quarters. Dio reports that he brought false charges against individuals to raise funds for building projects he could not fund. Many died in prison, some were executed or committed suicide. Dio also reports the general fear of the people and the magistrates (aediles and praetors), who were forced to resign and stand trial because of any connections with Caligula’s enemies. In short, there was serious opposition to Caligula by now, and his response was ruthless
3)	By AD 40 tensions between Caligula and senate became even more severe. Several prominent Romans were put to death, presumably for conspiracy. The background to the plot that brought an end to the reign is unclear. The most prominent names in the narrative were well known senatorial men and consulars, Lucius Annius Vinicianus and Decimus Valerius Asiaticus; other conspirators who were centrally involved were: Marcus Arricinus Clemens, the Praetorian prefect, and Gaius Julius Callistus, a powerful freedman of Caligula, who also would serve and intrigue in the court of Claudius, Caligula’s successor. The fatal blows were struck in an underground passage of the Palace during a festival there in January of AD 41, as Caligula was retiring for lunch, by two tribunes of the Praetorian guard, Cassius Chaerea and Cornelius Sabinus. In the chaos that followed the assassination, Claudius was discovered in a part of the imperial residence by members of the Praetorian guard, taken to the Praetorian camp, and acclaimed as the emperor.
4)	Caligula returned to Rome to celebrate an ovation on 31 August in 40. His absence may have been due to his fear of assassination. The conspiracy of Gaetulicus and Lepidus is said to have made him suspicious of the senate and aggravated his autocratic tendencies. It was probably about this time that he began to insist on the official cult to himself, in Rome; he also carried out another congiarium, a handout of gold and silver from the roof of the palace for several days, which led to a riot, in which almost 300 people were crushed to death (Dio adds they were killed by the pieces of iron that Caligula tossed down with the coins). Caligula did, in fact, meet his death as the result of a conspiracy, and his constant fears were justified. The plots against Caligula in the final six months are better documented than the earlier ones, but their precise nature and the true motives of the participants still elude us. The conspiracy basically rolled out in two phases of a single conspiracy: one phase dated to the last months of AD 40, the other phase reaching a finale in late January of AD 41. Jos. AJ 19.71; Suet. Cal. 37.1; Dio 59.25.5.
5)	According to Dio and Josephus, the final conspiracy was widely known, although Tacitus implies it succeeded because it was secret (Jos. AJ 19. 60-62 133; Tac. Hist. 3. 68. 1; Dio 59. 29). These two ideas can be reconciled if we think of a sweeping conspiracy that would have attracted a wide range of different conspirators whose inner group kept its secrecy, but whose fringe members were found out by Caligula. The sources are vague about the number of conspiracies against Caligula. Suetonius (Cal. 56.1) comments that before the final plot there were ‘one or two’ others, and that the prefects of the Praetorian guard were implicated in ‘in some conspiracy or other.’ Josephus says that conspiracies were ‘commonly’ formed against him and claims that the equestrians were involved (Jos. AJ 19. 14; 60-62). Caligula’s obsessive fear of a major conspiracy accounts for his ruthless behavior in the final six months of his life (Autumn of 40 and January 41). Seneca’s On Anger (de Ira 3.18.3-19) has left horrific descriptions of his brutality, especially towards senators: how he beat them to death, tortured them, gagged them with sponges to prevent them from crying out, beheaded them, and executed them in the evening because he was too impatient to wait until the next day. However, the sources are generally vague, and few names emerge.
6)	Early Phase of conspiracy (Sen. Ira 3.18.3; Dio 59.25.5-7 Suet. Cal. 26.3). Seneca also gives several grim examples of the execution of conspiratorial sons and fathers in front of each other at the outset of the final conspiracy. One father son duo worthy of mention (among many) is that of Betilienus Bassus, a quaestor and senator, and his father, a non-senatorial procurator, named Betilienus Capito. Capito was forced to be present at his son Bassus’ execution, although he was not guilty of any crime. Subsequently he saved his own life by offering to disclose the names of others involved, including the prefects of the Praetorian guard and the powerful freedman, Callistus in plots against Caligula. According to Dio, they all might have died had not Capito gone too far and added Caesonia (Caligula’s fourth wife) to the list of accused(!). The inclusion of Caesonia, is an obvious fiction. We don’t know what happened to Capito but the fact that he was forced to attend his son’s execution may suggest he was guilty of something. In any case, the charges were probably true; they hounded these men, but they survived to see Caligula assassinated (Barret).
7)	The most prominent senators who were involved from the outset were Lucius Annius Vinicianus, Valerius Asiaticus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Vinicianus was partly motivated by his friendship for M. Aemillius Lepidus,*and by the realization that he was a target of Caligula’s purge. As the ring-leader, he was also motivated not by a desire to restore the Republic, but rather to stage a usurpation by taking advantage of the hatred of Caligula. Valerius Asiaticus was an Allobrogian from Gaul and admired by Tacitus as the first Narbonese to attain the consulship (albeit suffet in 35 and 46). According to Seneca, he was a personal friend of Caligula through his friendship with Antonia, Caligula’s mother. Asiaticus developed a personal hatred of Caligula because he had publicly insulted his wife. (Sen. Cons. 18. 2; Jos. AJ 19. 159; Tac. Ann. 11. 1-3). Gaius Cassius Longinus (suffet cos. in 30) was governor of Asia. Dio reports Caligula recalled him after supposedly being warned by an oracle to beware of a Cassius (in fact, it was a different Cassius, Cassius Chaerea, his assassin). Cassius Longinus was the brother of Lucius Cassius who boasted that his ancestor had assassinated Julius Caesar; Gaius Longinus survived the conspiracy only to be exiled by Nero. (Suet. Cal. 57.1; Suet. Nero 37. 1; Jos. AJ 20. 1; Tac. Ann. 12. 11. 4, 12.12, 1, 16. 7. 3, 9. 1.22.9; Dio 59. 29. 3).
8)	Another group implicated was that of the Stoic philosophers who opposed emperors in principle as tyrannical. According to Seneca, a Stoic named Canus had a long quarrel with Caligula, got the best of him and was subsequently executed. But Canus also implicated other Stoics, whose deaths he allegedly and suspiciously prophesied (Tac. Ann. 3. 51.3; Ag. 4.1; Phil. 1.4.94.23; Sen. Ep. 29.6; Ben. 2.21.5). Notable among senatorial man who were also Stoics, and who died for their roles in the conspiracy, was Julius Graecinus, father of Agricola, who later conquered Britain. Seneca claimed Graecinus was executed because he was better than a tyrant (Sen. Ira 2. 33. 3-7); Tacitus, who was Agricola’s son in law, however, reports he was executed because he refused to prosecute Marcus Silanus (11e, 5-6). However, Graecinus died in Dec. of 40/Jan. of 41, surviving the trial of Silanus by two years. Thus, it is more likely that Graecinus’ refusal to speak out against Silanus’ condemnation offended Caligula, but not enough to murder him in 37/38, just enough to seal his fate when his name popped up again in the final conspiracy a couple years later (Barret). Both the senators and Stoics were generally not profiles in courage; they regularly revealed conspirators to save themselves and to accommodate Caligula.
9)	A consular plebeian (Sextus) Pomponius (Peddus), links the early and later phases of the final conspiracy. Pomponius, who was also an Epicurean philosopher, was betrayed by a disloyal “friend” named Timidius. Consequently, Pomponius’ mistress, Quintilia (who was also an actress) was interrogated and tortured; the torture left her disfigured. Caligula was so impressed by her courage that he gave her money and spared Pomponius; evidently overwhelmed with gratitude, Pomponius kissed Caligula’s foot. During her torture Quintilia allegedly gave a secret signal to reassure Cassius Chaerea, the Praetorian tribune who was designated to murder Caligula in the final phase of the conspiracy (Sen. Ben. 2.12.1; Jos. AJ 19. 32-36; Suet. Cal. 16. 4; Dio 59. 26. 4). Thus, the tradition that Chaerea and Quintilia were involved together suggests that the supposed ‘earlier’ and ‘later’ conspiracy were both part of the same operation, and at this point (Dec. 40) in the conspiracy, Caligula’s investigation revealed many more senators as conspirators. Now Caligula convoked the senate and pretended to grant amnesty for all except a few. “This statement caused even greater general anxiety since each senator now feared for himself. This was Caligula’s intention, and its least harmful result was an outbreak of abject sycophancy. At a more serious level, he succeeded in turning the senators against one another.” Barret
10)	And it is probably at this time (December of AD 40) that Caligula also increased the number of the Praetorian guards from nine cohorts to twelve. For his personal security Caligula also had a special corps of Germans, known for their physical strength and brutality. While Caligula dealt with opposition from the senate by playing on the insecurities or the ambitions of individual senators, and by pitting them against each other, he also lost the support of his own household staff. When Capito, as noted (slide 8), to save his own life, revealed the names of several conspirators, he included the freedman Callistus, (Dio 59. 25. 7). While the inclusion of Caesonia’s name is surely an error, the rest of Capito’s charges appear to be factual, although not carried out. Josephus implicates Callistus specifically, and in a later context Tacitus implies that Callistus had a major role in Caligula’s death, (this “fact” must have been reported in one of Tacitus’ earlier (lost) books. Suetonius also suggests that Callistus found allies among other important freedmen. In any case, after Caligula’s death Callistus remained a powerful figure at court and became minister to the emperor Claudius. Jos. AJ 19. 64-69; Tac. Ann. 11. 29. 1, 12. 1. 3; Suet. Cal. 56. 1; Dio 59. 29. 1).
11)	The sources report that by January of AD 41 Caligula was so obsessed by his suspicions, that he tried to incite divisions within his domestic staff, and created so much resentment that they betrayed him. The tradition that the emperor’s staff was not involved in the plot until the final phase may come from a desire to enhance the role of the senate in the plot, which as we have seen was not exactly robust . Caligula’s final weeks are more fully documented than any other period of his life, because of the detailed account provided by Josephus in The Antiquities; but the text is confusing and marred by a corrupt manuscript tradition. According to the sources, the execution was carried out by the Praetorian tribune Cassius Chaerea. In the mutinies on the Rhine after the death of Augustus, Chaerea courageously dealt with a mob of mutineers. No other details of his life are known, except that by 41 he was a tribune in the Praetorian guard. Tacitus (Ann. 1. 32.5) calls him a young man at the time of the mutinies (AD 14); at the time of the assassination, he is called a senior guard by Suetonius (Cal. 56. 2). Chaerea had the support of the other members of the guard: the tribune Papinius, otherwise unknown, but perhaps related to the Sextus Papinius, earlier executed by Caligula. Chaerea’s right-hand man in the execution of the murder of Caligula was another Praetorian tribune, Cornelius Sabinus (Dio 59.25. 5).
12)	Chaerea hated Caligula because he mocked him and insulted him (Suet. Calig 56.2) “When they had decided to attempt his life at the exhibition of the Palatine games, as he went out at noon, Cassius Chaerea, tribune of a cohort of the praetorian guard, claimed for himself the principal part, for Caligula used to tease him, a man already on in years, with voluptuousness and effeminacy by every form of insult. When he asked for the watchword Caligula would give him “Priapus” or “Venus,” and when Chaerea had occasion to thank him for anything, he would hold out his hand to kiss, forming and moving it in an obscene fashion.”
13)	Josephus reports Chaerea was so eager to do away with Caligula that he had to be restrained by the others, until it was finally agreed that they would make their move during the celebration of the Palatine games, which began on the 17th of Jan. The games were a good venue tactically for the assassination because they were held in a temporary theatre set in front of the palace, which could house thousands of spectators crowded into a confined space. (Jos. AJ 19. 80-83; Philo Leg. 250, 338). Not surprisingly, the murder was foretold by a proliferation of omens, which were not heeded by Caligula. When Caligula entered the temporary theatre on the Palatine in the morning, it was already crowded, and he was in a good mood; the atmosphere is described as chaotic confusion, a mob of senators, equestrians, freedmen and slaves, men and women which Caligula found amusing. But there was a problem: the plan had been to murder him at noon when he was en route to the palace to have his lunch. However, Caligula stayed on through lunch. Chaerea impatiently made his way to the exit. Feeling that the opportunity might be lost, Vinicianus got up to urge Chaerea, ‘to be bold,’ according to Josephus. This led Caligula to tug at Vinicianus’ toga and ask where he was going; consequently, Vinicianus had to remain seated for a while to keep up the appearance of normalcy.
14)	Supposedly, Nonius Asprenas* finally persuaded Caligula to leave, and just in time, according to Josephus, since Chaerea was on the point of abandoning the original plan and of returning to the theatre to take his chances at assassinating Caligula in his seat. As the imperial party left the theatre, Caligula’s uncle and successor, Claudius, Vinicianus’ brother-in-law Marcus Vinicianus and his colleague Valerius Asiaticus were at the front. The crowd was held back, having been told to show the emperor proper respect, but in fact, the conspirators wanted to make sure no one could get close enough to protect him (Jos. 19. 96-103; Suet. Cal. 56.2, 58. 1, Claud. 10. 1). Caligula followed behind, with a man, whose name is so confused in Josephus’ manuscript that he is unidentifiable (the usual reconstruction is Paulus Arruntius). For some unknown reason Caligula decided to take a shortcut and entered a narrow passageway, where there were no guards; he stopped to watch and chat with a group of performers.
15)	Josephus reports it was at this moment that the emperor Caligula met his end. (Jos. AJ 19. 102-5; Suet. Cal. 58. 1; Dio 59. 29). The precise details of his death have been handed down in different traditions because the text is corrupted. According to Josephus, Caligula behaved in a characteristically obnoxious fashion: Chaerea asked for the watchword and Caligula offered him the usual insulting reply, which led Chaerea to slash the emperor between the neck and shoulder. However, the blow was not mortal, and as Caligula, groaning in agony, tried to escape, he was confronted by Cornelius Sabinus the other Praetorian tribune, who struck him to the ground, at which point a crowd of assassins attacked hm. Suetonius reports there were two versions of the story of Caligula’s death (that differed in their details). One is basically that Chaerea crept up on him as he was speaking to the performers, and stabbed him in the neck, followed by Sabinus, who stabbed him in the chest. The other account has Caligula giving the password ‘Jupiter,’ at which Chaerea responded with ‘accipe ratum,’ possibly meaning ‘accept the fulfilment of your vow’ and drove his sword through the emperor’s jaw. (Suet. Cal. 58. 2-3)
16)	Whatever the exact circumstances, the sources agree that the first blow was not mortal. But Suetonius reports he was stabbed at least thirty times; Josephus names an Aquila as the man who struck the fatal blow. Dio’s claim that the assailants ate Caligula’s flesh is not true, but his observation that on the day he was assassinated Caligula received proof that he was not a god, surely is. (Sen. Cons. 18. 3; Jos. AJ 19. 105-113; Suet. Cal. 58. 2-3; Dio 59. 29. 7, 30. 1). In the confusion Vinicianus was seized, presumably by those Praetorians who were not involved in the plot, but luckily, he was taken to Clemens the praetorian prefect, one of the ring leaders in the conspiracy, and allowed to leave unharmed. This account, which stresses the great perils to which Vinicianus was supposedly exposed, may mean that the senator sought Clemens’ protection at the first sign of danger. Most of the conspirators seem to have escaped by the time Caligula’s German body-guards were able to force their way through to the scene. When they saw what had happened, they were outraged, and brutally sought revenge. Several of the assassins and innocent bystanders were killed.
17)	Incomparable brutality as only the Romans commit (!) In the meantime, others were found and killed. Josephus reports another praetorian tribune Lupus was dispatched to the palace to eliminate Caesonia and her daughter. When he entered, he found Caesonia stretched out by her husband’s corpse, stained with his blood, with her daughter Drusilla beside her. Caesonia died bravely: grief stricken over her husband's death, she offered her neck to the assassin, telling him to kill her without hesitation. Drusilla died after her, her head having been smashed against a wall.
18)	The accounts of Caesonia’s murder are confusing. In the narrative of Josephus (the only source to give an indication of its timing), it was not carried out until the evening of Caligula’s murder, after the senate had called an emergency meeting. Yet it is hard to believe that she would have stayed rather than try to escape, and it’s even harder to believe the conspirators would have waited until the evening allowing her the chance to escape. Another interesting detail is that Lupus was sent by Chaerea to the palace to murder her, when it was under the control of the Praetorian guard immediately after the assassination. The murder of Caesonia must have been decided on well in advance, to avoid any danger that she might become a focus of resentment and resistance, as Agrippina I and her sons had been in the reign of Tiberius, following the death of Germanicus. The murder of Caligula’s wife and daughter must have been planned from the beginning to follow Caligula’s death (again, incomparable brutality as only the Romans commit (!) Caligula’s body was taken to Lamii gardens, an imperial property on the Esquiline Hill outside the city. The arrangements were made by Herod Agrippa I. He went to the Esquiline to take care of the corpse, cremating it and burying the ashes. Returning from exile, Caligula’s sisters exhumed the ashes and gave them a proper cremation and burial. Caligula’s final resting place is unknown. His remains may have been deposited in Augustus’ Mausoleum (Jos. AJ 19. 237; Suet. Cal. 59.1).
19)	Suetonius 58 1. “On the ninth day before the Kalends of February (Jan.24) at about the seventh hour Caligula hesitated whether or not to get up for luncheon, since his stomach was still disordered from excess of food on the day before, but at length he came out at the persuasion of his friends. In the covered passage, through which he had to pass, some boys of good birth, who had been summoned from Asia to appear on the stage, were rehearsing their parts, and he stopped to watch and to encourage them; and had not the leader of the troop complained that he had a chill, he would have returned and had the performance given at once. 2. From this point there are two versions of the story: some say that as he was talking with the boys, Chaerea came up behind, and gave him a deep cut in the neck, having first cried, “Take that,” and that then the tribune Cornelius Sabinus, who was the other conspirator, faced Caligula, and stabbed him in the breast. Others say Sabinus, after getting rid of the crowd through centurions who were in on the plot, asked for the watch-word, as soldiers do, and when Caligula gave him “Jupiter,” he cried “So be it,” and as Caligula looked around, he split his jawbone with a blow of his sword. 3. As he lay upon the ground and with writhing limbs called out that he still lived, the others dispatched him with 30 wounds; for the general signal was “Strike again.” Some even thrust their swords through his privates. At the beginning of the disturbance his bearers ran to his aid with their poles, followed by the Germans of his bodyguard, and they slew several of his assassins, as well as some inoffensive senators.”
20)	Suetonius 59 1. “Caligula lived twenty-nine years and ruled three years, ten months and eight days. His body was conveyed secretly to the gardens of the Lamian family, where it was partly consumed on a hastily erected pyre and buried beneath a light covering of turf; later his sisters on their return from exile dug it up, cremated it, and consigned it to the tomb. Before this was done, it is well known that the caretakers of the gardens were disturbed by ghosts, and that in the house where he was slain not a night passed without some fearsome apparition, until at last, the house itself was destroyed by fire. With him died his wife Caesonia, stabbed with a sword by a centurion, while his daughter's brains were dashed out against a wall.”
21)	Fagan on the monarchy becoming increasingly autocratic: “Whatever damage Tiberius’ later years had done to the carefully crafted political edifice created by Augustus Gaius multiplied it a hundredfold. When he came to power in AD 37 Gaius had no administrative experience beyond his honorary quaestorship and had spent an unhappy early life far from the public eye. He appears, once in power, to have realized the boundless scope of his authority and acted accordingly. For the elite, this situation proved intolerable and ensured the blackening of Caligula's name in the historical record they would dictate. The sensational and hostile nature of that record, however, should in no way trivialize Gaius’ importance. His reign highlighted an inherent weakness in the Augustan Principate, now openly revealed for what it was-a raw monarchy in which only the self-discipline of the incumbent acted as a restraint on his behavior. That the only means of retiring the wayward princeps was murder, marked another important revelation: Roman emperors could not relinquish their powers without simultaneously relinquishing their lives.”
22)	In sum, the reign of Caligula exposed the weakness of the senate and the flaws in the system of the monarchy as it was conceived by Augustus. The fact that Caligula’s abuses of privilege were allowed to continue unchecked throughout his (mercifully) short reign reveals the weakness of the senate in the face of a monarch whose absolute authority was backed by the military, in this case the praetorians. There is little evidence that the senate tried or was able to act in any decisive way to curb the emperor's excesses until it supported the plan, conceived by the praetorians and the armies, to assassinate him.
Chapter 12: Claudius 
12a. Introduction and early life 
1)	The Sources on Claudius are equivocal: i. Seneca: In the Consolatio ad Polybium (Essays on Stoic Teachings), he praises Claudius; in his Apocolocyntosis (Pumpkinification) a political satire, he portrays him as a tyrant and an idiot. ii. Josephus: in the Jewish Wars he describes Claudius as capable, confident and self-determined; in the Jewish Antiquities, he accuses Claudius of weakness, indecision and dependence on his advisors. iii. Suetonius (Claudius) and Tacitus (Annals 11-12) portray Claudius as an incompetent idiot, a helpless puppet of formerly servile (freedmen) ministers and notorious wives. However, Tacitus also acknowledges his good military and administrative record, and he praises his industry and concern for public welfare.
2)	Historiographical issues In sum, Claudius ruled well, yet the surviving literary tradition is hostile, and depicts him as a tyrant and a victim of unscrupulous exploitation. However, imperial enactments preserved in inscriptions, papyri and the sources demonstrate his administrative abilities and sound policies. Why do the sources portray him with such hostility? And how do we explain his good record in administrative and foreign policy, if he was (portrayed as) such an idiot? The sources are biased because of the manner of his accession, his promotion of freedmen, and his physical limitations and lack of judgment, which are (arguably) the result of having been kept out of public life until adulthood.
3)	Claudius suffered from cerebral palsy, and congenital neurological damage causing physical impairment, something the ancients did not tolerate kindly. On his physical impairment: Suetonius Claud. 4. 6, 30; 2.1-2; Dio 60. 2.1–2, ; 12. 3; Sen. Apoc. 1. 2, 5. 2–3, Sen. 6.1 ;7. 3; Juv. Sat. 6. 622-23. Dio 60. 2.1-2 1. “In mental ability he was by no means inferior, as his faculties had been in constant training (in fact, he had actually written some historical treatises); but he was sickly in body, so that his head and hands shook slightly. 2. Because of this his voice was also faltering, and he did not himself read all the measures that he introduced before the senate, but would give them to the quaestor to read, though at first, at least, he was generally present. Whatever he did read himself, he usually delivered sitting down.”
4)	Suetonius Claudius 2. 1-2 1. “Claudius was born at Lugdunum on the Kalends of Augustus in the consulship of Iullus Antonius and Fabius Africanus and received the name of Tiberius Claudius Drusus. Later, on the adoption of his elder brother into the Julian family, he took the surname Germanicus. He lost his father when he was still an infant, and throughout almost the whole course of his childhood and youth, he suffered so severely from various obstinate disorders that the vigor of both his mind and his body was dulled, and even when he reached the proper age, he was not thought capable of any public or private business. 2. For a long time, even after he reached the age of independence, he was in a state of pupillage and under a guardian, of whom he himself makes complaint in a book of his, saying that he was a barbarian and former chief of muleteers, put in charge of him for the express purpose of punishing him with all possible severity for any cause whatever. It was also because of his weak health that contrary to all precedent he wore a cloak when he presided at the gladiatorial games which he and his brother gave in honor of their father; and on the day when he assumed the gown of manhood he was taken in a litter to the Capitol about midnight without the usual escort. Thus, it was that Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus, the son of Drusus, the son of Livia, obtained theimperial power without having been previously tested at all in any position of authority, except for the fact that he had been consul. He was in his fiftieth year.”
5)	Suetonius also provides a physical portrait of Claudius (30-31). “He was not short of either authority or dignity when he was standing up or sitting down, still less so when he reclined. He was tall but not lanky, and good-looking, with a fine crop of white hair and a well-set neck. But his knees were so weak that he staggered as he walked, and his habits were embarrassing, whether he was indulging in domestic or business affairs. He had an indecent laugh, and when he was annoyed. he foamed disgustingly at the mouth and his nose ran. He stammered, and his head twitched the whole time, but even faster when he was actually engaged in the slightest activity. He was always ill, until he became emperor. Then his health improved marvellously, except for attacks of stomach-ache, which he said even made him think of suicide.”
6)	Early life: Claudius had been deliberately kept out of sight all of his life of 50 years because of his physical infirmities. 
7)	It is useful to note that Claudius’s family suffered in the internal struggles for succession under Tiberius. His father, Drusus I died in 9 BC of battle wounds in Gaul, when Claudius was only one year old. His brother, Germanicus had died or perhaps had been murdered, under suspicious circumstances in AD 19. His sister, Livilla was allegedly involved in the conspiracy of Sejanus, and had died in prison, perhaps at the hands of his mother, Antonia Minor. Claudius survived because he was ignored and hidden away because he was an embarrassment to his family.
8)	Claudius’ own mother, Antonia Minor called him “a half-formed monster,” and criticized fools “more stupid than my son Claudius.” (Suetonius Claud. 3. 2). Antonia also compared him unfavorably to her other son, Germanicus and her husband Drusus I (Livia’s son). These quotes may come from the imperial archives (used by Suetonius). All members of Germanicus’ family are praised in the Senatus Consultum de Gn Pisone Patre, the official account of the imperial response to Germanicus’ death (AD 20). That is, all except for Claudius, who was after all Germanicus’ brother, but hardly mentioned (only at line 148).
9)	The correspondence of Augustus suggests a more balanced (if not kind) view of the young Claudius (Suetonius Claud. 4). Augustus (his great uncle) was aware of Claudius’ intelligence, however, he kept him out of sight, because he believed he was not fit for public service, given his physical deformities. In addition, Augustus was not generous to Claudius in his will: Claudius received only a modest legacy as an heir in the “third degree,” an empty gesture that promised no money. He fared no better under Tiberius, who did not admit him to the senate. And when Claudius tried for a chance to stand for the quaestorship, Tiberius dismissed his petition.
10)	It was during the reign of his nephew, Caligula, that Claudius was recognized, inducted into the senate, and made suffet consul in AD 37, although he was also the object of Caligula’s cruel humor (Suet. 7). E.g., he was nearly dismissed from his consulship when he was slow to erect statues at Caligula’s request, and he was also harassed in the courts by strangers and his own family: Once, when he greeted Caligula at a dinner in Lugdunum, on behalf of the senate to congratulate him for uncovering the conspiracy of Gaetulicus and Lepidus, he was thrown into the river, and all the guests were encouraged to throw food at him (Suet. Claud. 8–9; Dio 59. 6. 5–6; ). This was Claudius’ position in January of AD 41 when he was elevated to the throne at the age of 50, in the wake of Caligula’s assassination.
11)	Hated and neglected all of his life, Claudius is alleged to have been an alcoholic and a gambler. However, perhaps more interesting is that he was a scholar: 
a)	Claudius’ writings: Claudius started a history of the Civil Wars from the death of Julius Caesar to the death of Augustus; his mother, Antonia Minor and his grandmother, Livia kept him from writing about the difficult period of the Second Triumvirate that preceded the ascendancy of Augustus. Writing in the early second c. AD, Suetonius reports that in his day, 43 books of Claudius’ history survived; the book started in 44 BC then there was a gap for 43- 27, and it went straight to the period from 27 until the death of Augustus in AD 14 (eliminating the period of the Second Triumvirate). Claudius also wrote a defense of Cicero against an attack by Asinius Gallus, the son of Caesar’s, Octavian’s, and Antony’s partisan, Asinius Pollio, and a senator and orator, who criticized Cicero’s rhetorical style. Gallus was arrested in AD 30 (at the behest of Sejanus) and put to death in 33 for making a joke at Tiberius’ expense, intended to underline his autocratic rule (Tac. 1. 12; Dio 57. 2.6-7; 58. 3. In addition, Claudius wrote a treatise on gaming, inspired by his interest in gambling and finally, histories of Carthage and the Etruscans in Greek, a language he loved and had mastered.
b)	Because Claudius had developed an interest in history, Augustus appointed Livy, his official historian, as Claudius’ tutor. Claudius wrote an autobiography in eight books: Suetonius reports its style was presentable, but it included material incompatible with the dignity appropriate for an emperor (Tac. Ann. 11. 13-15; 22, 24, 61; Suetonius Claud. 24.1; 33. 2, 41). Unfortunately, none of his works is preserved
12b. Accession and early reign 
1)	The tradition of Claudius’ accession reveals several inconsistencies in the sources. Josephus contradicts himself in his account of Claudius’ elevation to the throne, and the negotiations between the senate and Claudius after the elevation. i. The most famous version of the narrative is reported in Suetonius (Claud. 10); Dio (60.1.2-3a); and Jos. (JA 19.212-20). In the aftermath of the assassination of Caligula, some of the praetorians went on a killing spree, and looted the palace; subsequently, Claudius allowed them to elevate him to the throne and paid them.
2)	The Praetorians found Claudius hiding behind a curtain. They declared him emperor and carried him off to their camp. Thus, according to this tradition, Claudius fell into power because of an accident, and against his will.
3)	The image of a passive and fearful Claudius dragged from behind a curtain conforms to the characterization that hounded him and continues to this day: the perception that he was undignified, weak, and manipulated by others.
4)	ii. According to a second version, (Jos. AJ 19.162-65) the elevation of Claudius was deliberately orchestrated by the Praetorians. As in the first version, Claudius was a passive and reluctant player in the process. After the murder of Caligula, the praetorians met in their camp and decided they needed to find an emperor, who would protect their favored terms of military service. They chose Claudius as the only surviving adult member of the JulioClaudian family. They sent out a party of troops to find him, and bring him back to their camp, and they acclaimed him emperor.
5)	iii. According to a third version, Claudius may have been more active in his elevation than is reported in the first two versions. a. Claudius himself may have been involved in the murder of Caligula: (Jos. AJ 19. 17–69; Tac. 11. 29; Suet. Cal. 56. 1; Dio 59. 25. 8, 29. 1–2). b. It has been argued that Claudius’ departure from the theater just before his (Caligula’s) assassination was too much of a coincidence. c. In addition, Claudius was a friend of the Jewish client king Herod Agrippa I, and he patronized him after the assassination, which may suggest that Herod Agrippa had helped him to gain the throne. Caligula had also promoted Herod Agrippa I; he made him a client king of territory in the Kingdom of Judaea that had belonged to Herod Agrippa’s uncle, Philip Herod II (see 11d; 12f). However, Herod Agrippa, may have wanted Caligula removed because of his policies towards the Jewish subjects (11d, 15-17); the sources report he spoke to the senate on behalf of Claudius and promoted his elevation, although he does not appear to have been implicated in the conspiracy to assassinate Caligula.
6)	However, this third scenario is speculative. i. The sources make no explicit mention of Claudius’ involvement or implication in his accession. ii. In addition, the argument is circular, and based on negative evidence: The argument is that because he was involved in the assassination and his own accession, Claudius may have suppressed evidence and promoted the “ unwitting or accidental ” accession story. I.e., The absence of evidence for Claudius’ active involvement is invoked as proof of it.
7)	Coins like this commemorate the elevation by the Praetorians. Obverse Claudius Reverse: Battlemented wall enclosing the praetorian camp; inside, a soldier, holding a spear, stands next to the stan-dards, under a pediment with flanking walls.
8)	Negotiations with the Senate after Caligula’s death: News of Caligula’s death prompted a meeting of the Senate. There was even talk of restoring the Republic and getting rid of emperors altogether. Some senators proposed that they be chosen as Caligula’s successor. A debate was in progress when news reached the senators that the Praetorian Guard had already made the decision for them: Claudius had been chosen by the Praetorians, and he was already at their camp.
9)	The response of Senate to this news is also not clear; the sources give two versions: i. The Senate sent two tribunes (with troops) to the Praetorian camp to force Claudius to step down (Suet. Claud 10. 3; Dio 60. 1-4; Jos. AJ 19.229-35). At the camp they saw that Claudius really was supported by the soldiers, so they backed off and summoned him to the Senate House to be ratified. ii. Herod Agrippa I was summoned by senate to act as an envoy in the negotiations between the Camp and the Senate ( Jos. AJ 19.239-45; Dio 60.8.2).
10)	Augustus annexed Judaea in AD 6. in AD 41 Claudius briefly restored Judaea to Herod Agrippa I who ruled it as a vassal kingdom. This political favor weakened Roman governance in the province of Judaea, when it was re-annexed by Claudius in AD 44 (9 h).
11)	This is a Cistophoric tetradrachm probably minted in AD 41-42, possibly in Ephesus. Obverse: Claudius. Reverse: COM ASI, (Communitas Asiae) placed on either side of a temple; the temple is inscribed ROM ET AVG; it encloses a statue of Augustus (referring to Claudius) in military dress, holding a spear, and crowned by a female figure (Fortuna) holding a cornucopia (horn of plenty).
12)	This bronze coin was minted in Caesarea Maritima in AD 42/43 by Herod Agrippa I. On the obverse: Agrippa and his brother Herod of Chalkis are shown in military armor, standing on either side of Claudius; his head is covered by his toga; they crown him; the inscription reads: “King Agrippa, Augustus Caesar, king Herod.” On the reverse is shown the image of two clasping hands; the inscription, arranged in two concentric circles, reads: “Covenant between king Agrippa and Caesar Augustus and the Senate and the people of Rome, friendship and alliance.”
13)	Regardless of the details, the manner by which Claudius was elevated is significant: Caligula was the first emperor to be murdered, and Claudius’ accession marks the first direct involvement of the military in this process. The Principate was supposed to be consolidated by the Augustan constitutional settlements (of 27, 23 and 19 BC). The new normal was that the emperor’s position depended on the military. G. Fagan: “The Principate had been revealed for what it truly was: an exercise in managing the military’s loyalties, and not a form of government rooted in law and consensus.” The Senate was out-powered by the praetorians and armies in the process of the elevation of the emperor to the throne.
14)	Suetonius 10 Version One 1. “Having spent the greater part of his life under these circumstances, he became emperor in his fiftieth year by a remarkable freak of fortune. When the assassins of Gaius shut out the crowd under pretence that the emperor wished to be alone, Claudius was ousted with the rest and withdrew to an apartment called the Hermaeum; and a bit later, in great terror at the news of the murder, he stole away to a nearby balcony and hid among the curtains hanging before the door. 2. As he cowered there, a soldier, who was prowling about at random, saw his feet intending to ask who he was, pulled him out and recognized him; and when Claudius fell at his feet in terror, he hailed him as emperor. Then he took him to the rest of his comrades, who were still in a condition of uncertainty and purposeless rage. These placed him in a litter, took turns in carrying it, since his own bearers had made off, and bore him to the Camp in a state of despair and terror, while the throng that met him pitied him, as an innocent man who hurried off to execution. 3. Received within the rampart, he spent the night among the sentries with less hope than confidence; for the consuls with the senate and the city cohorts had taken possession of the Forum and the Capitol, resolved on maintaining the public liberty. When he too was summoned to the House by the tribunes of the commons, to give his advice on the situation, he sent word that “he was detained by force and compulsion.” 4. But the next day, since the senate was dilatory in putting through its plans because of the tiresome bickering of those who held divergent views, while the populace, who stood about the hall, called for one ruler and expressly named Claudius, he allowed the armed assembly of the soldiers to swear allegiance to him, and promised each man fifteen thousand sesterces; being the first of the Caesars who resorted to bribery to secure the fidelity of the troops.”
15)	EARLY REIGN Damage Control Like his predecessors, Claudius started off well. Since he could not ignore the murder of Caligula, he punished Chaerea and the conspirators (Suet. 11). But no senators were punished, even those suspected of involvement. (Jos. AJ 19. 268–70; Suet. Claud. 11. 1; Dio 60. 3. 4-4. 5).
16)	At first Claudius kept a low profile. He refused excessive honors or titles. He forgave those who had wronged him before he became emperor. With the senate, he tried to maintain the pretense that he was an ordinary citizen, no more than first among equals. A show of modesty would distinguish him from Caligula, who had insulted the senatorial aristocracy with his arrogance and bizarre behavior.
17)	This aureus of Claudius underlines his clemency after Caligula’s assassination. The reverse image of Pax-Nemisis personified subdued vengeance or clemency. Claudius cancelled Caligula’s acta, granted amnesty to Caligula’s enemies and victims and recalled folks from exile
18)	The propaganda here: Claudius and Praetorian Guard deliver stability in Rome
19)	Claudius also gave the masses lavish gladiatorial shows (Suet. Claud. 21. 3-6, 34; Dio 60.13). He dropped Caligula’s treason trials. Claudius was supported by the praetorians and the legions. In addition, he supported the equestrian order, and promised to work on its behalf.
20)	Claudius’ challenge was to cultivate and maintain good working relations with a senate that was alienated from, and disgusted by Caligula, but that did not trust Claudius. The propaganda is promoted in the legend on the reverse of this coin: EX SC PP OB CIVES SERVATOS: Obv. Claudius Caesar Augustus the Pater Patriae (father of the country). Rev. By decree the Senate, for having saved the citizens.
21)	The Conspiracy of Camillus Scribonianus The first crisis came in AD 42, a year after Claudius became emperor, when an attempt was made to depose him in a military coup led by Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus, the governor of Dalmatia.* The execution of C. Appius Silanus (Messalina’s stepfather) in AD 42 was allegedly the immediate cause of the rebellion against the emperor. According to the sources, Silanus was murdered on an arbitrary whim of Messalina, the emperor’s wife who is typically portrayed in the sources as a villainous, conspiratorial adulteress (12g). Messalina and the imperial freedman Narsissus, often acting at her behest, habitually reported individuals whom they wanted eliminated, as involved in conspiratorial activity, preying on Claudius’ fears. (Dio 60.14). Narcissus who was Claudius’ powerful Secretary of State, reported to Claudius that he had had a dream in which he had seen Silanus kill the emperor.
22)	Among the conspirators, was Lucius Annius Vinicianus (again involved in a conspiracy to overthrow an emperor);* Vinicianus had led the senate’s negotiations with Claudius after the assassination of Caligula; Vinicianus had opposed Claudius’ elevation. Vinicianus appears to have been involved in the plot for the same reasons that he had played a central role in the final conspiracy to dethrone Caligula (11f): he was simply motivated by his desire to usurp power, and in need of military backing, he turned to Scribonianus. However, Scribonianus wanted to remove Claudius because he was also an aspiring usurper; Scribonianus’ legions swore allegiance to him, and he sent a letter to Claudius demanding his abdication. Then he fomented a revolt of his troops, the Eleventh and Seventh legions (Dio 60. 15–16).
23)	Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus was the natural son of Marcus Furius Camillus, the consul of AD 8; he was also the descendant of the Marcus Furius Camillus who sacked Veii in 396 BC and was the first Roman commander to celebrate a military triumph (Plut. Cam.1; Livy 5.21); in addition, he was the brother of Livia Medullina, who was supposed to marry Claudius before he was elevated to the throne but died on their wedding day (12g). At some point Scribonianus was adopted by Lucius Arruntius, the consul of AD 6. Tacitus reports that Arruntius was a wealthy, popular, and gifted enough consular to have been considered a potential successor to Augustus himself (Tac. Hist. 1.49; Ann. 1.13). As an aspirational usurper, Camillus Scribonianus, apparently hoped to realize what had been considered for his adoptive father. Scribonianus was consul in AD 32 with C. Domitius Ahenobarbus (the father of the future emperor, Nero), and he was later appointed by Caligula as military governor (Legate) in command of the legions in Dalmatia. Scribonianus was part of a network of influential and powerful families with illustrious ancestors; he was also related to Augustus’ wives Livia and Scribonia (Suet. Tib. 25; Tac. Ann. 27–32; Dio 57.15).
24)	Claudius had anticipated the plot (Dio 60.15). After five days, the soldiers became increasingly superstitious and feared the outcome of the revolt; consequently, the rebellion failed when they refused to march against the emperor (Suet. Claud. 13). Both legions were awarded the title Claudia Pia Fidelis for their loyalty to Claudius; Scribonianus was forced to take his life in Illyria. Suetonius Claudius 13: “The civil war was set on foot by Furius Camillus Scribonianus, governor of Dalmatia; but his rebellion was put down within five days, since the legions which had changed their allegiance were turned from their purpose by superstitious fear; for when the order was given to march to their new commander, by some providential chance, the eagles could not be adorned nor the standards pulled up and moved *(it was considered a bad omen if it was difficult to pull the standards from the ground). Scribonianus’ co-conspirator L. Caecina Paetus was taken as prisoner to Rome and condemned to death by suicide (Plin. Ep. 3.16; Dio 60.16), Vinicianus also took his life in the bloody aftermath. His sons would be implicated in a conspiracy against Nero (13f).
25)	Dio 60.14 3. “Claudius had sent for Silanus, who was of very noble family, and governor of Spain at the time, pretending that he required a service of him, had married him to Messalina’s mother, and had for some time held him in honor among those nearest and dearest to him. Then he suddenly killed him. The reason was that Silanus had offended Messalina, the most abandoned and lustful of women, in refusing to lie with her,* and by this slight shown to her had alienated Narcissus, the emperor's freedman. 4. As they had no true or even plausible charge to bring against him, Narcissus invented a dream in which he declared he had seen Claudius murdered by the hand of Silanus; then at early dawn, while the emperor was still in bed, trembling all over, he related to him the dream, and the empress Messalina, taking up the matter, exaggerated its significance.” *Accusations of committing incest were standard tropes as we have seen to defame men and women
26)	Dio 60. 15 1. “Thus Silanus perished because of a mere vision. After his death the Romans no longer cherished fair hopes of Claudius, and Annius Vinicianus with some others straightway formed a plot against him. Annius was one of those who had been proposed for the throne after the death of Caligula, and it was partly fear inspired by this circumstance that caused him to rebel. 2. As he possessed no military force, however, he sent to F. Camillus Scribonianus, the governor of Dalmatia, who had a large body of citizen and foreign troops and enlisted his support; for Scribonianus was already making his own plans for an uprising, more especially because he had been spoken of, for emperor. 3. When Annius had got thus far, many senators and knights flocked to him; but they were of no use; for the soldiers, when Scribonianus held out to them the hope of seeing the republic restored and promised to give back to them their ancient freedom, suspected that they should have trouble and strife once more and would therefore no longer listen to him. At this Scribonianus became frightened and fled from them; and coming to the island of Issa (off Illyria) he there took his life.”
27)	4. “Claudius for a time had been in great terror and had been ready to abdicate his power voluntarily in Scribonianus’favor; but he now recovered courage. He first rewarded the soldiers in various ways, especially by causing the legions composed of citizens (the Seventh and the Eleventh) to be named Claudian and Loyal and Patriotic by the senate. Then he sought out those who had plotted against him, and on this charge put many to death, among others a praetor, who first was made to resign his office. 5. Several, indeed, including Vinicianus, committed suicide. For Messalina and Narcissus and all the latter's fellow freedmen seized this opportunity to wreak their direst vengeance. They employed slaves and freedmen, for instance, as informers against their own masters. 6. These masters and others of the highest birth, foreigners and citizens alike, and not only plebeians, but some of the knights and senators as well, were put to the torture, despite the fact, that Claudius at the very beginning of his reign had sworn not to torture any freeborn man.”
28)	This 17th century bronze statue group of the death of Paetus and Arria refers to a story, as told by Dio (60. 16. 6-7) When Paetus , a co-conspirator, was ordered to commit suicide, to encourage him and allay his fears, his wife Arria wounded herself : “Arria who was the wife of Caecina Paetus, refused to live after he had been put to death, although, being on very intimate terms with Messalina, she might have occupied a position of some honor. Moreover, when her husband displayed cowardice, she strengthened his resolution; for she took the sword and wounded herself, then handed it to him, saying: “See, Paetus, it doesn’t hurt.” 7. These two persons, then, were accorded praise; for by reason of the long succession of woes, matters had now come to such a pass, that excellence no longer meant anything else than dying nobly.”
29)	The bronze statue group is inspired by the ancient marble group of the Ludovisi Gaul, shown on a semi-circular base, killing himself, having killed his wife before the enemy could do. This group was originally part of and named for the Ludovisi Collection, and it is housed in the Museo Nazionale in Rome. It is a Roman copy of a Hellenistic (3rd c. BC) lost bronze original
12c. Domestic government laws
1)	Claudius and the Senate 
a)	In AD 44 Claudius restored the provinces of Achaea and Macedonia to the senate. Tiberius had made these imperial for purposes of defense. Claudius also returned control of the election of magistrates to the senate. Caligula had taken this privilege away; he had reversed Tiberius’ policy of restoring control of elections to the senate.
b)	 However, several measures offended and alienated the senate. In AD 47 Claudius revived the office of censor and gave it to himself (Suet. 16, 22), which the aristocracy regarded as inappropriate. In addition, Claudius’ use of the censorship to undertake blanket enfranchisement and induction of provincials into the senate, caused alarm. Claudius was also intrusive: he enforced senate attendance, e.g., speeches of Claudius, preserved in papyri, chastise the senate for indecision and obsequiousness. For the sake of efficiency, Claudius encroached on certain activities and functions that had been the prerogative of senate.
2)	Promotion of Equestrians
a)	Claudius promoted equestrians over senators, and opened more opportunities and posts to equestrians. This sometimes interfered with senatorial privileges and mandates. E.g., Claudius took control of the administration of the grain dole which had been senate’s domain, and he gave control of it to the equestrians. He even appointed equestrians as governors in senatorial provinces (!).
b)	But Claudius also interfered with equestrians: He meddled in their business affairs and commercial ventures. He tried to reform taxation in provinces, including private taxation by the publicani. His heavy-handed policies angered some equestrians and there were conspiracies: Claudius responded by executing 300 equestrians.
3)	Promotion of freedmen, provincials and procurators:
a)	Claudius became more autocratic as his reign progressed. His most significant change to administration was the admission of freedmen (former slaves), equestrian procurators, and provincials to high positions in the imperial civil service. Claudius transferred several functions from the senate to the branches of the imperial civil service, which were now headed by freedmen-ministers, who reported directly to him.
b)	Under Claudius, government fell increasingly to the emperor and his agents: his freedmen and equestrian procurators. Claudius’ mandates were not so much the result of a deliberate policy of centralization, but rather the use of more individual laws and edicts to address immediate issues, on an ad hoc basis. The delegation of responsibilities to procurators* in the provinces, and freedmen as ministers in his civil service (and in the courts) was central to the process of increasing the autocracy of the emperor. And because Claudius was on the throne for such a long time, these measures became permanent; arguably they became policy.
c)	One reason for these changes was the increasing quantity of public business at home and in the provinces; more agents attached to the court, were needed to deal with it. And from now on, as the state grew in size and complexity, emperors increasingly relied on freedmen, and managed the state like an extended household. This practice had developed from earlier convention: Wealthy Romans had used freedmen as secretaries and estate managers. Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula had also employed them in the imperial service.
d)	That said, during Claudius’ reign freedmen attained their greatest prestige. Like the imperial procurators, they owed their loyalty only to the emperor (Tac. Ann. 12. 23; Dio 60. 25. 6–7; Suet 28). Claudius also developed a more centralized bureaucracy. He created specialized departments, each headed by a freedman minister and staffed by provincials. Freedmen had enormous power and authority as his first ministers. They were not accountable to the senate, but rather (directly) to the emperor, Claudius.
e)	Claudius’ New departments were headed by freedmen: 
i)	Secretary of State (official correspondence): Narcissus. 
ii)	Department of Finance: Pallas. 
iii)	Department of Petitions and Judicial inquiries: Callistus. 
iv)	Department of Libraries and Writing: Polybius. 
v)	These men of humble origin became rich and powerful. The new system alienated the old senatorial aristocracy and enhanced the autocracy of the emperor, a growing feature of the monarchy in imperial times.
f)	Claudius’ Fiscal policies were autocratic: 
i)	Claudius exercised complete imperial control of finances without the participation of the senate. Finances were controlled by Claudius and his ministers. Control was also centralized: The emperor controlled not only the Roman treasury, but also all provincial treasuries. Claudius appointed his own quaestors to administer the treasury rather than allowing the senate to elect them. Claudius’ freedman ministers even controlled finances in the senatorial provinces (at the behest of Claudius).
g)	Jurisprudence 
i)	Claudius imposed intrusive and arbitrary conditions on the law courts (Suet. Claud. 14, 23. 1; 15; Dio 60. 4. 3-4). His desire for efficiency also informed his judicial policies; his interest in jurisprudence prompted him to “correct” abuses in the system. He took measures to expedite transactions of business in the courts. He also insisted on judging cases that had previously been judged by the senate; a parallel judicial system was developing at this time, and it gave him the chance for more direct engagement with the courts.
h)	Claudius presided over informal trials in improvised “kangaroo” courts: Tac. (Ann. 11.1-3; 12. 43; Suet.( Claud. 15. 3, 18. 2; 29.2) Sen. Apoc. (12. 3, 19–22; 14. 1–2) He could do this because the courts were more flexible than the older praetorian courts that had addressed specific breaches of law. Claudius used cognitiones (inquiries; cognitio singular) for all kinds of infractions committed by all kinds of people. He also used his own private court (intra cubiculum) to accuse whomever he wished, charge him as he chose, and hear cases on his own prescribed conditions. The sources report when he presided at public trials, he was on view, and this exposure invited the same disrespect in the courts, as at the games.
i)	Suetonius reports Claudius evinced a mean streak in his behvior in the courts. His policies did not sit well with the senate. The senate feared his freed-men, who played on his fears of conspiracies to eliminate folks in the courts.
j)	Claudius may also have been misled into committing injustices. These have probably been exaggerated in sources, and arguably his sound judgment is demonstrated by the evidence of laws he passed against usury (extortionate moneylending) and the mistreatment of slaves, preserved in inscriptions. That said, many laws (mentioned in the sources) do appear petty, arbitrary and cruel.
k)	Claudius passed a proliferation of laws, through the senatus consultum or decree, presumably with or without a coerced senate. Much of his legislation was consistent with a desire to maintain the stratification of Roman society, a concern that he addressed during his censorship, but also throughout his reign. Claudius’ rulings reinforced status distinctions between senator, equestrian, freeborn, freedman and slave.
l)	In sum, the following measures had the greatest impact: i. The expansion of the authority given to procurators in the provinces. ii. The mass enfranchisement and promotion of provincials in statecraft and in the Roman senate. iii. The promotion of freedmen in high-ranking ministerial positions in the imperial service. iv. The increased judicial responsibility of imperial appointees, who owed loyalty to the emperor alone, which came at the expense of senatorial authority, and diminished the auctoritas patrum.
12d. Public works religious policy 
1)	Shipping and Infrastructure Tacitus Annals 12. 56–7; Suetonius Claudius 18–21. 1; Dio 60. 6. 8, 11. 1–5. Claudius supported public works and public assistance. He passed a law punishing investors who purchased and then demolished buildings and farms for profit. His mandates were intended to promote agriculture, prevent the destruction of small farms and revert farmland to pasture for animal grazing.
a)	Support of commercial shipping:
i)	Claudius improved the transport of the corn supply by insuring ships and their cargoes against damage by storm, and theft of cargoes by pirates. He also rewarded citizens for building ships with incentives, like rebates on taxes and shipping fees. He paid for these measures out of his own privy purse.
2)	Aqueducts Right: Porta Maggiore
a)	Claudius completed aqueducts that Caligula had started, e.g., the Aqua Claudia. Claudius built a new aqueduct called the Anio Novus; the water channels of the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus entered Rome and met at the Porta Maggiore. He restored a third aqueduct, the Aqua Virgo, originally built in 19 BC by Marcus Agrippa.
b)	 Water channels of the Anio Novus and Aqua Claudia on top of the Porta Maggiore 
c)	 Claudius also restored the Aqua Virgo.
d)	 Completed by Marcus Agrippa in 19 BC at his own expense, the Aqua Virgo was built to supply water to the Campus Martius (the armies). Its source was located to the east of Rome on the estate of Licinius Lecullus. Aqua Virgo entered Rome from the North. 
3)	Claudius resumed projects that had been started by Julius Caesar: at Ostia he enlarged (dredged) the harbor at the north and linked it to the Tiber River with a man-made canal (Suet. Claud. 20). Consequently sea-going ships could now call to port and transfer cargoes to barges, which could take them right up to Rome.
a)	Claudius built granaries and a light house at Ostia. 
b)	Turned Ostia into a industrial park. 
c)	In 52 Claudius drained the Fucine Lake (in central Italy) into the Liris River, a project Caesar had started. He constructed a tunnel 5.5 km long as an outlet to River. The project resulted in the reclaiming of large area of central Italy for farming.
d)	These building projects provided jobs and promoted farming. E.g., the Fucine Lake project (to drain lands around the Fucine Lake) took eleven years, employed over 30,000 men and provided arable land for agriculture in central Italy. Claudius’ policy of development and urbanization to make jobs resumed and emulated Caesar’s policies.
4)	Religious Policies. Claudius was conservative and he restored the old state cults, following Augustan policy. He had a personal interest in Etruscan religion and thus encouraged and maintained the Etruscan diviners (the haruspices). He allowed some foreign cults, banished astrologers from Italy, and tried to abolish Druidism, although even after the Roman conquest of Britain, Druidism survived in the northwestern areas outside of the province. Claudius was harsh with the Jewish population in Rome, but he protected the rights of Jewish subjects in Alexandria. 
5)	Claudius extended the pomerium of Rome to include the Aventine Hill and the Campus Martius. This privilege was traditionally reserved for victorious generals who had extended frontiers, or for censors. Claudius' usurpation of it offended the old aristocracy, although he did this 5 years after his British victory.
6)	Druidism: Suet 25. 5: “he utterly abolished the cruel and inhuman religion of the Druids among the Gauls, which under Augustus, had merely been prohibited to Roman citizens.” Claudius was tolerant of eastern cults as long as they were not harmful to traditional Roman religion. He also allowed the cult of Cybele to exist in Rome with modifications to make it consistent with Roman practices (the Romans of the early empire found the castrated priests (galli) of Cybele objectionable.
7)	Eunuchs (castrati) were generally associated with eastern courts in late antiquity. The Romans of the early empire sometimes had them as slaves and priests, but generally disapproved of the practice of castration. Vespasian was a eunuch dealer while he was governor of North Africa. His son, Domitian and Hadrian tried to curb castration and declare it illegal within the frontiers of the Empire, although both Nero and Domitian allegedly had eunuchs. Terence's comedy, The Eunuch written in the 1st half of the 2nd c BC is the earliest surviving Latin text to use the word ‘eunuch.’ The Digest of Justinian (48), had several laws in place regarding the castration of eunuchs. The cult of Cybele (also called Magna Mater by the Romans) was brought to Rome from the east in the final years of the Second Punic War, by the Scipionic circle, including Scipio Africanus and his wife Tertia Aemilia. Claudius’ alleged revival of the cult of Cybele required changes to make it consistent with Roman norms, and thus is believed to fit into the context of the disapproval of castration. Under Claudius, the nature and structure of the cult changed and a new sanctuary for the worship of the cult was established to the northwest of the circus maximus.
8)	Claudius also introduced the official recognition of Cybele’s priest (or gallus) and consort, whose name was Attis, with the creation of a new festival, the Hilaria (which took place from the 15th to the 27th of March), in honor of Attis’ death and resurrection. The ritual of the Taurobolium, a bull sacrifice with a blood-drenching for the initiate, also accompanied the Hilaria. The Taurobolium was most likely introduced as a ritual substitute, which would have allowed Roman citizens to hold the position of archigallus (high priest of Cybele) without castration, which the Romans of the early empire viewed as disgusting (inscriptions associate the Taurobolium with the cult to Cybele, (CIL 13.1751 = ILS 4131 (CIL 13.7281 = ILS 3805). However, it has also been argued, basis on figurines of Attis, that the priesthood might have been integrated into the Cult of Cybele in Rome with Attis playing a larger role in cult than has previously been assumed. Some have even argued that Attis and his rituals were accepted with the cult, as early as the late 2nd c. BC when the Cult of Cybele was first brought to Rome.
9)	Judaism: Claudius reversed Caligula’s policies of interference within provincial cities (e.g., Alexandria and Jerusalem). He also restored freedom of worship and exemption from subsidizing imperial cults. However, Claudius was not tolerant of Jews in Rome, and he expelled them from Rome, as Suetonius writes (25.4) “Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome.” Dio describes a less severe response (60. 6. 6-7): “ As for the Jews, who had again increased so greatly that by reason of their multitude, it would have been hard without raising a tumult to bar them from the city, he did not drive them out, but ordered them, while continuing their traditional mode of life, not to hold meetings.”
10)	Overlife size bronze statue of Claudius found in situ in 1741 in the Augusteum at Herculaneum, now in the Naples Archaeological Museum. The Augusteum was a sanctuary dedicated to the imperial cult; Augustea were established throughout the empire as cult centers or sanctuaries in honor of the imperial family. This Augusteum was located in a porticoed square in the heart of Herculaneum’s public area, on the main street. The dedicatory inscription found with the statue dates the statue to AD 48. Claudius is depicted in heroic nudity; he was the first Roman emperor to present himself as such in a (public) western sanctuary.
12e. Foreign policy west 
1)	Claudius’ foreign policy was inconsistent: On the one hand, like Tiberius, Claudius followed Augustus’ policy of expanding frontiers only when it was necessary for imperial defense, and arguably the annexation of the two provinces of Mauretania was undertaken in the name of defense. * On the other, he waged wars of conquest in Britain, and added several new provinces to the empire. *To subdue revolts that erupted after Caligula murdered Ptolemy I
2)	Claudius was hailed as imperator by the praetorians: on the day he became emperor; (later) for the conquest of Britain; and for other occasions as well; twenty-seven times in all, a measure of the strong bond between the army and emperor. The effort in Britain restricted action elsewhere. Claudius claimed credit for the victory in Mauretania, but the victory was not entirely his (since the chronology of events is debated 11d). The worst of the revolt in Mauretania had been repressed near the end of Caligula’s reign. Consistent with the modest profile that Claudius promoted, he settled for triumphal honors; the only “real” triumph he accepted was for the conquest of Britain (Dio 60. 8. 6, 60. 9).
3)	Claudius added five provinces to the empire: AD 43 Lycia. AD 43 Britain. AD 44 Mauretania Tingitana. AD 44 Mauretania Caesariensis. AD 46 Thrace. Claudius followed a policy of annexation, replacing client kingdoms with direct Roman rule, although he also maintained vassal kingdoms.
a)	The Kingdom of Mauretania revolted when Caligula executed its king (Ptolemy 11d). Claudius neutralized the last pockets of resistance. In AD 44 the territory was subjugated and annexed as two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis (east) and Mauretania Tingitana (west). 
i)	Dio Cassius 60. 9.1-6 Romans defeat Mauretanians; Claudius annexes provinces 1. “The next year the same Moors again made war and were subdued. Suetonius Paulinus, one of the ex-praetors, overran their country in turn as far as Mount Atlas, and after him Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, a man of the same rank, made a campaign, marching at once against their general Salabus and defeating him on two different occasions. 2. When Salabus thereupon left a few soldiers near the frontier to hold back any pursuers and took refuge himself in the desert, Geta ventured to follow him. First stationing a part of his army opposite the detachment that was lying in wait, he pushed forward after providing himself with all the water possible. 3. But when this began to give out and no more was to be had, he found himself in the direst straits. For the barbarians, on their part, could hold out a long time anyway against thirst as the result of habit, and moreover could always get at least some water by reason of their familiarity with the country, and so they managed to get along; whereas the Romans, for the opposite reasons, found it impossible to advance and difficult even to retreat. 4. While Geta, then, was in a quandary as to what he should do, one of the natives who were at peace with the invaders persuaded him to try some incantations and enchantments, telling him that as the result of such rites abundant water had often been given to his people. No sooner had Geta followed this advice than so much rain fell from the sky as to allay the soldiers' thirst completely and at the same time to alarm the enemy, who thought that Heaven was coming to the assistance of the Roman general. 5. Consequently they came to terms voluntarily and ended their warfare. After these events Claudius divided the subject Moors into two districts, the first embracing the region around Tingis and the other that around Caesarea, from which cities the districts are named; and he appointed two knights as governors over them. 6. At this same period certain parts of Numidia also were attacked by the neighboring barbarians, and then, when the latter had been defeated in battle, became quiet once more.* The freedmen, on their part, persuaded Claudius to accept the ornamenta triumphalia for his exploits in Mauretania, though he had not gained any success, and had not yet come to the throne when the war was finished.” *This is not entirely accurate and intended as an insult, reminding the reader that Claudius was beholden to freedmen ministers.
b)	 Conquest of Britain (Suet. Claud. 17; Dio 60. 19-22). In AD 43 Claudius conquered (southeastern) Britain. Claudius joined his general, Aulus Plautius, who took the campaign up the Thames, and commanded “with Claudius” in the end, to a victory. Southeastern Britain was annexed as the province of Britain in AD 43.
i)	For Claudius, the role of commander-in-chief would give him the chance to gain credibility with the army, which would protect him from ambitious generals in the future. The conquest of Britain had been in the planning since the first incursions of Julius Caesar in 55 and 54 BC (5f). Augustus contemplated invasion, and Caligula had gone as far as to enrol two new legions and organize the logistical support that in fact Claudius would find in place. Rome found an excuse for intervention in the internal conflict among local warlords, as well as the persistent practice of Druidism, which the Romans regarded as a dangerous venue for subversive, pan-Celtic, anti-Roman activity.
ii)	Aulus Plautius was given the command as a reward for his loyalty in the conspiracyand revolt (by Scribonianus) at the end of AD 42. The troops were initially unwilling to embark on the ships that would take them across the Channel, which was thought to mark the border of the known world, until they were shamed on board by Claudius’ freedman Narcissus, who was there on behalf of the emperor. Once across, the force advanced quickly, meeting only some sporadic resistance. Claudius’ role was a bit of theater: Plautius halted when he reached the Thames, having been instructed to send for the emperor if he ran into “difficulty.” Claudius’ presence in Britain was pre-arranged: the required time for travel precluded an unanticipated appearance; i.e., he was already there on site, just waiting for his cue.
4)	The Britons, led by Caratacas, the chief of the Catuvellauni, and his brother Togodumnus, did not want to fight a pitched battle, but instead used guerilla tactics. However, Plautius defeated first Caratacus on the River Medway, then Togodumnus on the River Thames. Togodumnus died shortly afterwards. Caratacus survived to be paraded around Rome in Claudius’ military triumph and continue to engage in battle with the Romans in Britian.
5)	The casus belli or pretext for war was the necessity to restore the Roman friendly king, Verica of the Atrebates to power; he had been deposed by Caratas and the Catuvellauni, who lived to the south of the Atrebates.
6)	Claudius was summoned, joined the waiting forces, took “nominal” command, and “led” the troops into the local capital of Camulodunum (Colchester) in triumph. The victory must already have been achieved, since Claudius would never have dared to venture into an uncertain situation. Claudius could now claim military success, although it had come with little danger or discomfort to himself (as in Mauretania). Claudius returned to Rome in AD 44 after 6 months, during which he spent only a few weeks in Britain. Claudius celebrated a triumph, staged a re-enactment of the “storming” of Camulodunum and received the honorific sir-name Britannicus for himself and his descendants (e.g., his son) from the senate .
7)	Aulus Plautius
a)	As Quaestor during the reign of Tiberius (AD 20/21), Plautius compiled the text of the Senatus Consultum of the senator Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso (10c). In 26 he served as praetor urbanus (the city judge who heard the cases of citizen residents in the courts of Rome) and suffet consul in AD 29. He is mentioned as a legate in an inscription found north of Tergeste (Trieste), which suggests that he was legionary legate in northern Italy, probably stationed at nearby Aquileia. After Claudius conquered and annexed Britain as a province, he named Aulus Plautius as its first military governor or Legate. In 47 Plautius was the last senator allowed to march into Rome in a minor triumph (ovatio). Thereafter, military triumphs of any kind were only given to members of the imperial court.
b)	Dio 60. 21 On the Conquest of Britain by Claudius: Insinuations of the fakery of the campaign 1. “Shortly afterwards Togodumnus perished, but the Britons, so far from yielding, united all the more firmly to avenge his death. Because of this fact and because of the “difficulties he had encountered” at the Thames, Plautius “became afraid,” and instead of advancing any farther, proceeded to guard what he had already won, and sent for Claudius. 2. For he had been “instructed to do this in case he met with any particularly stubborn resistance,” and, in fact, extensive equipment, including elephants, had already been got together for the ex-pedition. When the message reached him, Claudius entrusted affairs at home, including the com-mand of the troops, to his colleague Lucius Vitellius, whom he had caused to remain in office like himself for a whole half-year; and he himself then set out for the front. 3. He sailed down the river to Ostia, and from there followed the coast to Massilia; thence, ad-vancing partly by land and partly along the rivers, he came to the ocean and crossed over to Britain, where he joined the legions that were waiting for him near the Thames. 4. Taking over the command of these, he crossed the stream, and engaging the barbarians, who had gathered at his approach, he defeated them and captured Camulodunum, the capital of Cunobellinus (father of Caratacas and Togodumnus). Thereupon he won over numerous tribes, in some cases, by capitulation, in others by force, and was saluted as imperator several times, contrary to precedent; 5. for no man may receive this title more than once for one and the same war. He deprived the conquered of their arms and handed them over to Plautius, bidding him also subjugate the remaining districts. Claudius himself now hastened back to Rome, sending ahead the news of his victory by his sons-in-law Magnus and Silanus (Silanus was his future son-in law). 22. 1 The Senate on learning of his achievement gave him the title of Britannicus and granted him permission to celebrate a triumph.”
c)	Suetonius 17 1. “He made but one campaign and that of little importance. When the senate voted him the triumphal regalia, thinking the honor beneath the imperial dignity and desiring the glory of a legitimate triumph, he chose Britain as the best place for gaining it, a land that had been attempted by no one since the Deified Julius and was just at that time in a state of rebellion because of the refusal to return certain deserters. 2. On the voyage thither from Ostia he was nearly cast away twice in furious north-westers, off Liguria and near the Stoechades islands. Therefore, he made the journey from Massilia all the way to Gesoriacum by land, crossed from there, and without any battle or bloodshed received the submission of a part of the island, returned to Rome within six months after leaving the city and celebrated a triumph of great splendor. 3. To witness the sight he allowed not only the governors of the provinces to come to Rome, but even some of the exiles; and among the tokens of his victory, he set a naval crown on the gable of the Palace beside the civic crown, as a sign that he had crossed and, as it were, subdued the Ocean. His wife Messalina followed his chariot in a carriage, as did also those who had won the triumphal regalia in the same war; the rest marched in purple-bordered togas, except Marcus Crassus Frugi, who rode a caparisoned* horse and wore a tunic embroidered with palms, as he was receiving the honor for the second time.”
d)	Camulodunum, (Colchester) became a Roman colony. The frontiers and beyond were protected by client kings. 
e)	Aureus: Claudius commemorating actions in Britain. In AD 49 Claudius celebrated a military triumph and paraded the British chieftain Caratacus through the streets of Rome (Tac. Ann. 12. 36). In the same year he also gave the title “Britannicus” to his son and extended the pomerium (12d; Tacitus 12. 24).
f)	This aureus or gold coin (RIC I, 33) depicts the triumphal arch erected in Rome in AD 44, commemorating Claudius’ conquest of Britain. On the obverse is a laureate (crowned) bust of Claudius facing right. On the reverse is an equestrian victory statue of the emperor (on a horse) between two military trophies. The arch itself was a converted aqueduct which crossed the main road leading north toward Rome. Inscription Expansion and Translation (the inscription on the obverse is retrograde (right to left) Obverse: TI. CLAVD. CAESAR. AVG. P. M. TR. P.. VI. IMP. XI. Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus, Pontifex Maximus, Tribunicia Potestate Sexta, Imperator Undecimus. Translation: Tiberius Claudius Caesar, emperor (Augustus), high priest, holder of tribunician power for the sixth time, supreme commander (Imperator) for the eleventh time. Reverse: DE (victis) BRITAINN (is) on architrave of the arch,: Victory over Britons.
g)	INSCRIPTION FROM THE VICTORY ARCH OF CLAUDIUS, IN ROME The inscription reports that the arch of Claudius in Rome was set up by the Senate and People of Rome to commemorate the reception by Claudius of the formal submission of eleven Kings of the Britons. “The Senate and People of Rome [dedicated this] to Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus because he received into surrender eleven kings of the Britons conquered without loss and he first brought the barbarian peoples across the Ocean under the authority of the Roman people.”
8)	Claudius made no attempt to add territory to Germania, but rather continued a policy of keeping belligerent tribes pacified (or at war against each other) and out of Gaul. He recovered the last of the three standards lost by Varus in AD 9, a symbolic victory that brought Claudius another honor. AD 49 the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo quieted discord among the Frisii and the Chauci, then withdrew his force to the west bank of the Rhine, a policy consistent with containment, rather than conquest. Corbulo was soon recalled because Claudius felt threatened by his command, which was a significant force.
a)	Located in Aphrodisias (Caria in southwestern Turkey), the Sebasteion was a huge temple complex dedicated to Aphrodite and the Julio-Claudian emperors. It was begun in c. AD 20 and completed in AD 60, from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero. The complex was paid for by two prominent Aphrodisian families. The building consisted of a Corinthian temple and a narrow processional avenue (90 x 14 m), which was flanked by two portico-like buildings (arcades), each with threestories (12 m high), of superimposed Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns.
b)	The North and South Buildings, defining the processional avenue, were adorned with marble reliefs in the upper two stories and covered the entire length of the building. The reliefs were framed by columns so that the two facades looked like framed picture in a gallery. Two hundred reliefs were required for the whole project, and more than eighty have been recovered in excavations. They featured Roman emperors, Greek myths, and a series of personifications of kingdoms and provinces now the possession of Augustus’ world empire, from the Ethiopians of eastern Africa to the Callaeci of western Spain. The Sebasteion reliefs reflect contemporary historical interest by the imperial Romans, in the visual culture and urban life of the Greek East, which was now part of the Roman empire.
c)	The South Building was sponsored by the two brothers, Attalos and Diogenes, and their families. The third story displayed figures of Greek gods next to early Roman emperors and scenes of their conquests e.g., Claudius over Britannia, pictured at the right, and elsewhere Nero over Armenia. The emperors are shown as, active members of the traditional Greek pantheon. Claudius, in heroic nudity apart from his helmet, cloak, sword-belt and scabbard, is shown striking a fallen woman modelled on an Amazon; she is a personification of Britain and commemorates Claudius’ victory. A Greek inscription identifies him: Tiberios Klaudios Kaisar (Caesar).
12f. Foreign policy east, provinces 
1)	Although there were upheavals in the eastern Mediterranean during Claudius’ reign, he avoided making major changes to any political settlements in the region: essentially, Roman policy was passive and based on exploiting local divisions without committing significant military resources. In Asia Minor Claudius followed Augustan precedent: he built roads and developed cities; he contained threats by force, or by using buffer states, vassal kingdoms, and the encouragement of internal unrest within hostile tribes; for the most part, Claudius’ policy toward border territories alternated between the installation of friendly kings and the annexation of kingdoms as provinces. There were however two places where trouble was growing, and whose political situation Claudius could not resolve during his reign: The Kingdom of Parthia and the Kingdom of Greater Armenia.
2)	Herod Agrippa I was a client king of Rome under Caligula and Claudius. Herod Agrippa I, King of Judaea 37-44 AD.
3)	Judaea
a)	Shortly after he became emperor (AD 41), Claudius gave the province of Judaea to Herod Agrippa I, the Jewish*, Idumaean (from Idumaea) prince who had allegedly helped him to take the throne. The Herodian dynasty was a dynasty of Idumaean descent which ruled the Herodian Kingdom of Judaea and later the Herodian Tetrarchy as a vassal state of the Roman Empire. The Herodian dynasty was established in ca. 40 BC by Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judaea, with Roman support, and (as we have seen 4g) brought down the Hasmonean Dynasty. Herod the Great brought Hasmonean blood to the Herodian Dynasty by marrying a Hasmonean woman named Mariamme the Hasmonean. *The Idumean ancestors of the Herodian kings were not born Jewish but were converted.
b)	Herod the Great ruled as a tyrant but he was a loyal friend and client of Rome. His reign was violent and marked by interfamilial conflict and power struggles, largely resulting from his having ten wives and thus many heirs. He executed several members of the Hasmonean branch of the family: these included Herod Agrippa’s father Aristobulus IV, for treason, in 7 BC when Herod Agrippa was a young child. Herod the Great spared the children of Aristobulus IV and his wife, Herod Agrippa’s mother, Berenice. As Herod Agrippa was not a favored heir apparent, Herod the Great sent him to Rome as pignus in ca. 5 BC, to ensure mutual detente and support from Rome; consequently, Herod Agrippa grew up under the patronage of the Julio-Claudians.
c)	We don’t know much about Herod Agrippa’s mother Berenice, but she was a political pawn for Herod the Great, who set her up in another arranged marriage after the death of her first husband. She was married to an uncle of the eldest son of Herod of the Great, named Theudion who was also executed by Herod the Great sometime before his death in 4 BC (A.J. 17.70 and 73 B. J. 1. 553). Consequently, Berenice was widowed twice within a few years. The sources report that she raised her children in Rome, where she found refuge, and was a great friend of Antonia Minor, the daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia, and the mother of Claudius (A. J. 18.143, 165). Antonia was allegedly involved in Herod Agrippa’s upbringing and Berenice bequeathed her freedwoman Marsias to Antonia when she died in Rome in AD 23 (A.J. 18. 145; 156).
d)	 When Herod the Great died in 4 BC his kingdom was divided among his sons as a tetrarchy or territorial division for four rulers. Most of the tetrarchies, including Judaea proper, were incorporated into the Province of Judaea in AD 6 when, as we have seen, Augustus annexed it (9h). But in AD 37 Caligula gave Herod Agrippa parts of the Tetrarchy that had been ruled by Herod the Great’s son Philip Herod II (11d).
e)	In AD 41 Claudius rewarded Herod Agrippa for his help in obtaining the throne (whatever that might have involved exactly). Claudius bestowed consular rank upon him, and he also transferred the Roman province of Judaea to him (12b; 9h; Cass. Dio 60, 8, 2). Thus, Herod Agrippa briefly ruled over the entire restored kingdom of Herod the Great until his own death in AD 44, at which time Judaea became a province again. (Jos. BI 2,178-220; Jos. Ant. Iud. 18,126-366). Claudius simply re-annexed it as the province of Judaea (Tac 12, 23). However, from now on, Judaea was to be governed by a procurator, an administrator with less military authority than a prefect, (the type of military governor Augustus had originally appointed; see 9h). Consequently, the weakened authority of Rome in the area compromised governance, which became more arbitrary and despotic, and eventually led to a serious uprising in Judaea and a war with Rome.
4)	Lycia (formerly a kingdom in southwest Turkey) was annexed in AD 43, after a revolt, which killed several Romans (Dio 60, 17. 3).
5)	In AD 46 Thrace lost its independence and was annexed as a Roman province, after the death of the Thracian king Rhoemetalces III (in AD 44 at the hands of his wife), and a failed anti-Roman revolt (Syncellus 631).*
6)	Claudius supported friendly kings in Commagene and the Bosporus (Dio 60. 8.1).
7)	The Roman provinces of Achaea and Macedonia were transferred from imperial to senatorial control (Suet. Claud. 25. 3).
8)	Rhodes was annexed in AD 44: “The Rhodians were deprived of their liberty because they had impaled some Romans” (Dio 60, 24. 4).
9)	AD 44 Restored Provinces of Macedonia Achaea to Senate 
10)	The annexation of Thrace prompted Roman intervention in Romania, the Crimean peninsula and areas north of the Black Sea as far east as Don River, which flows from the northeast into the Asov Sea. Suetonius: “Claudius made the Black Sea into a Roman lake.” His policy was expansionist, since it was not really necessary for defense.
11)	The Kingdom of Parthia and the Kingdom of Greater Armenia. Rome had held Parthia in check during the reign of Claudius by stirring up factional strife and maintaining a friendly vassal king on the throne of the Kingdom of Greater Armenia; however, the policy began to falter at the end of Claudius’ life and would require a new political settlement under Nero. (Tac. Ann. 11. 10; 12. 10).
12)	The Kingdom of Greater Armenia Tiberius had installed Mithridates in AD 35 as vassal king of Armenia; Caligula dethroned and imprisoned Mithridates (11d, 11) as a favor to the Parthian king in AD 37. Claudius restored alliance with him, released him from prison and sent him back to Armenia in AD 41, thus re-securing Roman control (by proxy) of the Kingdom of Greater Armenia for a bit. The Kingdom of Armenia was the center of contention between Rome and Parthia: it was useful to the Parthians, as a kingdom for a junior princes or minor kings to rule, but Rome had laid claim to it in the 30’s BC (thanks to the successful campaigns of Mark Antony) and did not want to give it up as a vassal kingdom. Augustus had not tried to annex Armenia in 20 BC when he went east to Armenia and mandated Agrippa and Tiberius to negotiate and oversee the return of the Roman military standards from the Parthians taken in the Battle of Carrhae (it would have been very difficult); Augustus installed a friendly vassal king to rule Armenia at the behest of Rome.
13)	Although this arrangement was a practical solution, it was difficult to keep reliable vassal kings on the throne of Armenia. E.g., imperial princes and commanders had fallen in the process of maintaining order (and Roman friendly kings) in Armenia: Augustus lost his grandson Gaius Caesar in AD 4 and his grandnephew, Germanicus in AD 19 in this undertaking. The policy was continued by Tiberius, when Artaxias (who had been crowned by Germanicus), died in AD 35: Tiberius authorized the use of military force to prevent Artabanus, the king of Parthia from trying (again) to seize the throne of Armenia. The Romans succeeded and as noted, Tiberius installed Mithridates; Caligula subverted the arrangement (by recalling Mithridates to Rome); and Claudius restored Mithridates in AD 41, threatening Artabanus of Parthia with war if he interfered again.
14)	The Kingdom of Parthia While all of this was going in Armenia, Parthia was divided and there was civil conflict, which caused more problems for Claudius. In AD 49 dissident Parthians turned to Rome to ask for support to remove the reigning king Gotarzes II (Tacitus, Annales 11. 8-9; 10 ). Claudius sent them a Parthian prince Meherdates, a weak claimant and allegedly the son of a pretender, and he ordered Gaius Cassius Longinus, the military governor (Legate) of Syria, to escort him to the Kingdom of Parthia and remove Gotarzes II. However, Gotarzes II was ready for them with auxiliary armies, and he defeated Meherdates (he was mutilated but his life was spared) with the result that the eastern frontier was thrown into chaos (Tacitus, Annales 12. 10-22).
15)	Armenia Meanwhile in Armenia, in AD 51 the problems on the eastern frontier worsened in the client kingdoms of Iberia (present day eastern Georgia) and the Kingdom of Greater Armenia. The king Mithridates, whom Claudius had restored, was expelled, and murdered by his nephew Radamistus of Iberia. The Romans made a weak intervention which led to defeat and the fall of the Roman strongpoint at Gornea to Radamistus. The legionary legate Caelius Pollio (under the new Legate of Syria Ummidius Quadratus) surrendered it and the campaign failed. Into the void left by the Roman loss, the Parthians intervened and took control (Tacitus, Annales 12. 44- 49; 50-51). Radamistus was defeated by forces of the new Parthian king Vologeses and expelled in AD 51 or 52. The new king of Parthia saw Armenia as suitable for his brother Tiridates to rule, since the Romans could not, or were not willing to defend it. Radamistus made a brief comeback in 54 the year of Claudius’ death, but Vologeses reinstalled his brother Tiridates. In sum, when Claudius died in 54 the east was in this disturbed situation.
16)	In sum, Claudius had gained influence in Greater Armenia, which had a Roman friendly king; but at end of Claudius’ reign Vologeses I took the throne of Parthia, and he put his pro-Parthian brother Tiridates on the throne of the Kingdom of Greater Armenia.
17)	Globalization: Claudius promoted globalization and the broad-scoped enfranchisement of provincials. He undertook a comprehensive policy of enfranchisement in Gaul. He did not campaign (in Germania Magna) east of Rhine, following late (and post) Augustan precedent. Many of his policies promoting the integration of provincials into Roman governance and statecraft are compared to those of Julius Caesar.
18)	Claudius raised the status of the provinces with massive grants of citizenship and with Latin rights in un-Romanized areas of the empire. The scope of this program was innovative. His generosity is summed up (in an unflattering way) by Seneca: Claudius would enfranchise anybody who would wear the toga.
a)	The Edict of Claudius aka the Edict of the Anauni is inscribed on a tablet, known as the Tabula Clesiana, in Trento. It dates to AD 46. The Anauni were an Alpine tribe that had taken the Roman citizenship [ jus honorum] “informally.” Claudius’ edict confirmed the legitimate citizenship rights for them.
b)	Lyon Tablet AD 48: A speech given to the senate by Claudius (as censor) is preserved in an inscription on a tablet known as the Lyon Tablet where it was found. The subject concerns the necessity of inducting Gallic chieftains into the senate. A summary of the speech is also found in Tac. (11.23-25).
19)	Provincial administration: Claudius extended frontiers, where plausible and prudent, and he promoted good provincial administration. The enfranchisement and promotion of provincials in Roman statecraft raised the status of the provinces. Claudius’ policies alienated the old senatorial families of Rome, who rejected admission of provincials to the nobility and to the Roman senate, and his use of equestrian procurators in the provinces probably (also) alienated many provincials.
20)	Claudius’ policies were prompted by a sincere desire for efficiency at home and abroad, and the elevation of provincials to the same level as Roman citizens. To this end, Claudius created a huge central bureaucracy, which undermined the old governing senatorial aristocracy, and put enormous power in the hands of one man, himself. Ministers and procurators were no longer elected or chosen from the senatorial aristocracy, but rather from equestrians, provincials and freedmen by the emperor. Claudius’ policies disturbed the fragile balance of powers between the princeps and the senate, the so-called dyarchy, which Augustus had tried to establish with the Settlements or Agreements of 27 BC and 23 BC. Yet we can argue that it was never really there, since Augustus took care to ensure that the emperor controlled the armies.
12g. Court intrigue Messalina 
1)	The sources devote a disproportionate amount of attention to the court intrigues of Claudius. That said, Claudius was “incurably uxorious,” his private life was troubled, and his marriage troubles may have informed his rule.
2)	Messalina: Claudius’ wives and freedmen are reported to have wielded great power over him. He had four wives, and he was twice married before he took the throne. The last two, to whom he was married as emperor, disgraced themselves and embarrassed the court; they also played a prominent role in the competition for the throne, and they were implicated in palace intrigues.
3)	Early Marriages and engagements (Suetonius 26.-27) Claudius was betrothed twice and married four times in the years before he became emperor (Suet. Claud. 2, 4. 1–5). Engagements: 1. The first plan was that Claudius should marry a cousin, Aemilia Lepida, the daughter of Lucius Aemilius Paulus and the younger Julia, granddaughter of Augustus. This marriage would keep the prestige of her birth within the larger family. The betrothal was broken off , however, when her parents were charged with adultery and treason in AD 8 (and banished by Augustus). 2. Next, Claudius was betrothed to Livia Medullina Camilla,* who was connected to important families of the day and descended from the legendary Camillus of the 4th c BC. She died on their wedding day. * Her brother was Camillus Arruntius Scribonianus who revolted against Claudius (12b slide 22 ff)
a)	Early Marriages 1. In AD 12 Claudius married Plautia Urgulanilla, whose father had been a military companion of Tiberius and whose grandmother Urgulania was a close friend of Livia. Claudius and she had two children: a. A boy, Drusus, who died in an odd accident around AD 24 or 25 when he choked on a piece of fruit that he was juggling. b. An infant daughter, Claudia, who was removed from the household shortly after Claudius divorced Urgulanilla at about the same time, on suspicion of adultery and homicide. Claudia’s paternity was suspect because of her mother’s unfaithfulness. 2. Claudius next married Aelia Paetina, who belonged to the family of the praetorian prefect, Lucius Aelius Sejanus. The choice reveals Sejanus’ influence during the third decade of the first century. a. A daughter, Antonia, was born to Claudius and Aelia by AD 29. However, by AD 31 when Sejanus was outed and executed, Aelia Paetina's connection with Sejanus became a serious impediment; Claudius divorced her to make room for a more suitable marriage sometime before the elevation of Caligula.
b)	Valeria Messalina 3. It was probably early in Caligula’s reign that Claudius married his third wife, Valeria Messalina. As the great-granddaughter of Octavia through Antonia Major,* sister to Claudius’ mother, Antonia Minor, Messalina was part of the extended imperial family, and thus Claudius’ first cousin once removed. Claudius and Messalina had two children: a. A daughter, (Claudia) Octavia, born in AD 38/ 39/early 40. b. A son, Tiberius Claudius Caesar Germanicus, born in AD 41, who would be known as Britannicus. *older sister of Antonia Minor widow of Drusus and mother of Claudius etc.
i)	This Roman coin struck under Claudius, shows on its reverse the personification of Spes (Hope) conflated with the empress, who is labeled as Augusta. The type was issued to commemorate the birth of Claudius’ Son, Britannicus in AD 41. In the sources, Messalina is portrayed as a cruel, licentious woman, who is reported to have aggravated Claudius’ fears of conspiracies.
ii)	Messalina with her son, Britannicus and daughter (Claudia) Octavia. Claudius’ wives during his reign dominated the narrative because they were prominently involved in the succession struggle. Messalina’s prestige derived from her Julian blood, and the fact that she was the mother of the heir apparent, Britannicus. Claudius allowed her to participate in his triumph, use the ceremonial carriage, and have a seat of honor at the games. She is reported in the sources to have orchestrated the prosecution and death of many innocent men and women.
iii)	Messalina with son, Britannicus: Messalina was also accused of promiscuity and palace intrigue (Tac. Ann. 11. 30, 36; 13. 11. Dio 60. 22. 4-5; 28. 2-4. Pliny NH 29. 8. 20). Messalina’s cruelty and arrogance spawned the rumor that she opened a brothel in the palace, where she forced upper class women to work. She allegedly would slip out of her bedroom at night and play the role of a common prostitute with sufficient enthusiasm to outlast her colleagues (Dio 60. 18. 2. Pliny NH 10. 172. Juv. 6. 114-32).
c)	Valeria Messalina: 1 daughter & 1 son: Britannicus and Claudia Octavia 
d)	Charges of promiscuity are the typical misogynistic qualifiers we find in the historical tradition, however, in this case they had real (political) relevance: They cast doubt on the paternity of Britannicus, and were useful to those who did not want to see him elevated to the throne. After she died, Messalina’s son, Britannicus, and Nero, the son of Agrippina II became contenders for the throne. Although Nero had seniority because he was older, the supporters of Britannicus claimed precedence for him, because he was the emperor, Claudius’ natural son. However, if his mother had had multiple partners, the seeds of doubt regarding the boy’s paternity could be planted, and Nero’s supporters raised doubts (Suet. Nero 7. 1. [pseudo-Sen.] Octavia 536).
e)	That said, Messalina was not a loyal wife, and she met her end by trying to use her charms and her connections to her advantage. In AD 48 Claudius was 57 and, although he was not dying, Claudius was nearing the end of his life; Messalina was much younger, and Britannicus was only seven. It would be difficult for Messalina to have political influence if Claudius were to die before his son were to come of age and be elevated to the throne. Acting on her political concerns, or perhaps not, in AD 47 Messalina took up with a protector and the consul elect for AD 48, Gaius Silius. In autumn 48 she (strangely) divorced Claudius on her own initiative; she and Silius married publicly and celebrated afterward with a large party.
f)	“Messalina was infamous most of all for the supposed crime for which she was executed in AD 48: marrying one of her (many) lovers, with whom she was possibly planning a coup, in a bigamous mock ceremony while Claudius was out of town. It is a puzzling act, so reckless as to be either apocryphal or, as the ancient sources insist, insanely real.” Timothy Farrington Review of Messalina: Empress, Adulteress, Libertine: The Story of the Most Notorious Woman of the Roman World by Honor Cargill-Martin (2023),
g)	The fall from grace and subsequent execution of Messalina, is one of the most dramatic episodes in the Julio-Claudian period. The events are covered in Tacitus (Ann. 11.12, 26–38); Suetonius (Claud. 26.2, 29.3, 36, 39.1); Dio (60 (61). 31. 1–5); and Juvenal ( Sat. 10. 329–45). Tacitus thought the story was so bizarre and unbelievable that he prefaced his narrative with a statement that, fantastical as it all seemed, his account was verified by the verbal and written testimony of his elders. Modern scholars wonder what to make of the events surrounding Messalina’s murder because they defy credulity. Tacitus reports in 47 Messalina began to feel a crazed passion for Gaius Silius, the most handsome man in Rome and a consul designate. She forced him to divorce his wife, Junia Silana, and had an open affair with him. Tacitus underlines Silius’ difficult position: if he refused Messalina, he would be a victim of her revenge, but if he complied, there might be some advantage to his taking the risk. Although the affair was conducted openly, Claudius was ignorant of it for a year (Tac. Ann. 11.12). The next year in 48 when Messalina grew restless, Silius (now consul) proposed that she divorce Claudius and marry him. When Claudius was away at Ostia, she married him publicly, and the couple threw a party (Tac. Ann. 11. 26, 11. 31 .4–6).
h)	After the wedding, Claudius’ freedmen, particularly Narcissus, denounced her and orchestrated her death, revealing only enough to Claudius to alarm him, and encourage him to passively follow his advice. Messalina’s death was ordered by Narcissus without Claudius’ knowledge, by pretending to represent his orders to the praetorians. Messalina faced death in a cowardly manner. Accompanied only by her mother, she recoiled from the sword (offered to her to commit suicide) and was run through by the guard. When informed of her death, Claudius showed no emotion for days (Ann. 11.37–8). Tacitus’ account is vivid and dramatic: Messalina desperately tried to save herself and begged for her life as the mother of Claudius’ children (whom she dragged to her panicked pleas with him for her life). But how true is the story? It is not entirely untrue. The outlines of Tacitus’ account are confirmed in other sources. Messalina’s fall from grace is attested by inscriptions; other writers report her affair and marriage with Silius, and the plotting of the freedmen. Dio (60 [61]. 31. 1–5), states Messalina was doomed when she orchestrated the fall of Polybius, one of her lovers and the imperial secretary, thus losing the trust of the freedmen. The claim reflects the tradition of the ‘real’ power behind Claudius’ throne: wives and formerly servile advisors, a feature of the ancient accounts of the reign. Juvenal (Sat. 10.329-45) emphasizes Silius’ impossible position, caught between Messalina’s demands and Claudius’ anger.
i)	Messalina with her mother plead for life with Narcissus
j)	An alternative interpretation of the affair sees Messalina as an astute and shrewd agent in court politics, who, as a woman, used sex as a political tool. She was in her early twenties when she married Claudius and approaching thirty when she died, so not a child. The events of AD 48 were therefore either part of a wider plot or a political maneuver designed to benefit her somehow. The truth may be found somewhere in between these two views-apolitical versus politically motivated, and it depends on how we read the sources and our understanding of the Julio-Claudian principate, specifically the imputation of treason by Augustus to any form of adultery or sexual misconduct by imperial women; for this would in fact make the crime political, with or without any political motive. The fact that Messalina deliberately ruined rivals, both men and women, during her marriage to Claudius, allegedly sending some to their deaths (e.g., Silanus 12b), reveals her political cunning. She also slept with some powerful men in the court of Claudius, including Polybius, Silius himself, a consular and others. The arguments Tacitus puts into Silius’ mouth, urging Messalina to marry him, including mention of accomplices and promises of Messalina’s continued power are more political than romantic (Tac. Ann. 11. 26. 2–4). Claudius’ freedmen led by Narcissus were also moved to act against her by fear for their position, which would have been threatened by Messalina’s marriage to another man (Tac. Ann. 11. 28. 1).
k)	If politically motivated, what was the context of the affair and marriage? Some scholars propose a formal political plot involving a senatorial faction intent upon usurping power. But what were the goals? Was Messalina planning to replace Claudius with Silius ? Were Messalina and Silius planning to restore the Principate? Was Messalina trying to secure her position in the court? Or were the freedmen plotting to bring Messalina down?
l)	Those who believe that Messalina’s affair and marriage to Silius was a political conspiracy,* suggest the plan that Silius would serve as a custodial, surrogate regent for the minor Britannicus or become emperor himself, until Britannicus came of age to take the throne (Sejanus aspired to this role 10 d and 10e). Presumably, it was hoped that Messalina’s Julian connections would help secure the loyalty of the military legions for the new ruling family. Messalina may have become impatient or fearful, deciding to execute this risky plan because Agrippina II was waiting on the sidelines with her own son (Nero). However, that doesn’t mean that Messalina was launching a conspiracy; she might have just needed protection. I.e., the power struggle between Agrippina II and Messalina might have disrupted the court, leading Messalina to Silius, but we have no clear reference to a palace conspiracy involving Messalina and Silius, and intended to remove Claudius from the throne in the face of Agrippina’s growing influence (see 12h). *Barret (A. Barrett 1999 Agrippina: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Early Empire (n. 12), 91–4; M. T. Griffin, Nero: The End of a Dynasty (New Haven, 1984), 29.
m)	Here Suetonius is revealing; for in his accounts of the affair and marriage of Messalina with Silius (Claud. 26. 2 and 29. 3), the scandal is not characterized as a political conspiracy. Furthermore, in his chapter on conspiracies (Claud. 13), where he lists the various plots against Claudius, he omits the Silius affair, but includes it in his chapter on baseless reports of plots (Claud. 36). While marriage and sexual misconduct were both fundamentally political in the endogamous, competitive context of Julio-Claudian marriage and the imperial court, Messalina’s unforced errors in this case would not be consistent with the political guile imputed to her by those scholars who identify the Silius affair as a conspiracy. The benefits to Messalina of alienating Claudius also would not make sense and do not explain the facts. In sum, we must admit that the political context of her affair and marriage to Silius remains unresolved, and we will never know what Messalina was really like, or what she was thinking when she took up with Silius.
4)	Finally, if it was a conspiracy, it was an amazingly incompetent one:* the affair and marriage were not a secret, but conducted openly and became common knowledge in Rome (Tac. Ann. 11.12.4, 11.27–8); following the marriage, the “conspirators” made no effort to obtain wider political and military support. Instead of carefully advancing their plans after their marriage, the “conspirators” did nothing, and then threw a wild party. Despite the executions that followed in the Praetorian camp, no one was accused of treason, not even Silius. And who was in the “conspiracy”? Aside from Silius there was only one other senator, and he was a nobody. Claudius’ reaction to Messalina’s misconduct was also unrealistically restrained compared with the responses of emperors (e.g., Caligula) when conspiracies were revealed. E.g., after the murders of Messalina and Silius, there was no round up of the suspects involved with accusations, interrogations, forced suicides, and executions.
5)	Fagan (2002) has proposed, the narrative makes more in the context of Messalina’s actions as they relate to the “structural matter at the heart of the Principate:” “Messalina took action that the Principate as an institution could not tolerate. Given the problem of the succession and the loose arrangements that Augustus and other emperors were forced to adopt to deal with it, sexual misdemeanors by favored princesses (never mind incumbent empresses) were automatically imbued with a perceived political dimension in a way that the affairs of emperors or princes were not. Princesses before Messalina had made similar mistakes and paid a price no less terrible for having done so.” (e.g., Julia I, Julia II, Livilla, Agrippina I (innocent but accused of one) and Agrippina II etc.
6)	The common factor that connects all these punitive measures against imperial women is the position in which the Principate, as an institution, put women, regardless of the degree (if any) of their motives, political or otherwise. It did not matter whether adultery by an imperial woman was politically motivated as part of a dynastic plot, or whether it stemmed from personal circumstances; it was a political act, for it impugned a male heir’s paternity and polluted the system of hereditary succession. Augustus established this principle when he made adultery a treasonable offense within the imperial family (Tac. Ann. 3.24.2–3), and it applied only to the women and the men (who were involved by association), who were punished by exile or death, along with the woman. This rule reflects how sexual misbehavior by an imperial woman per se, was a political threat to emperors and imperial heirs, because it raised questions about their paternity and thus eligibility to rule. The political dimension of adultery by imperial women lay in the act of adultery itself and required no conspiracies.
7)	Returning to Messalina and Silius, what happened in October of AD 48 is not certain. An adulterous affair was risky, but an open marriage involving a sitting empress was suicidal. It is possible that the detail of the marriage was introduced after the fact as part of trumped-up charges levelled against the adulterers once they were discovered. But the evidence, such as it is, suggests otherwise: 1. The wedding is reported in all the sources as a fact. 2. The wedding plays a pivotal role in the events. Although everyone but Claudius knew about the affair between Silius and Messalina for a year, no one had said anything about it until after the wedding (Tac. Ann. 11.12.4; Suet. Claud. 26.2); thus, it played a key role in the episode since it is what provoked the freedmen to risk speaking out and informing Claudius (Ann. 11. 28-29). If the marriage is removed, so is the motive of Claudius’ freedmen for breaking their silence. 3. The story of the marriage made Claudius look idiotic, and unable to control his own wife. Why would he (the emperor!) have wanted to invent this embarrassing detail and publicize it? For these reasons, the marriage must have been an “insanely real” event. (I.e., it must have happened!).
8)	In sum, the broad historical context of imperial women ensured that the revelation of Messalina’s infidelity and marriage was viewed in political terms. Narcissus confirms this when he tells Claudius that the people, senate, and soldiers have seen her transgression with Silius (Tac. Ann. 11.30.5). Appearances mattered. Messalina’s mistake led to her death. As Fagan notes, the actions of the characters as reported offer a better guide to the importance of this episode than speculations concerning Messalina’s motives, which are unknown to us. The actions reveal: i. A formal political conspiracy by Messalina and Silius is unlikely. ii. The political dimension of the event is Messalina’s adultery, worsened by her choice of an aristocratic, consular lover and her public marriage to him. iii. Precedent shows misdemeanors such as this by imperial women were interpreted as politically subversive, whether or not they were intentionally so. “The role of human passions, not noted for their obedience to reason, ought not to be discounted entirely from consideration of this curious episode (as it so often has) but, regardless, Messalina had crossed a clear line in the sand and there was already a long and sorry tradition of punishing analogous behavior among imperial princesses. It was a lesson seldom learned twice.” Fagan
9)	The following sections of Suetonius on Claudius reveal Claudius’ servile obedience to his wives and fear of conspiracies; they do not characterize the marriage to Silius by Messalina as politically motivated. 26. 2. “Then he married Valeria Messalina, daughter of his cousin Messala Barbatus. But when he learned that besides other shameful and wicked deeds, she had actually married Gaius Silius, and that a formal contract had been signed in the presence of witnesses, he put her to death and declared before the assembled praetorian guard that in as much as his marriages did not turn out well, he would remain a widower, and if he did not keep his word, he would not refuse death at their hands. 29. 3. It is beyond all belief, that at the marriage which Messalina had contracted with her lover Silius, he (Claudius) signed the contract for the dowry with his own hand (after he had been informed about the marriage), being induced to do so on the grounds that the marriage was a feigned one, designed to avert and turn upon another, a danger which was inferred from certain omens to threaten the emperor himself (i.e., it was meant to protect Claudius from some threat). 36. He was so terror-stricken by unfounded reports of conspiracies that he had tried to abdicate. When a man with a dagger was caught near him as he was sacrificing, he summoned the senate in haste by criers and loudly and tearfully bewailed his lot, saying that there was no safety for him anywhere; and for a long time, he would not appear in public. His ardent love for Messalina too was cooled, not so much by her unseemly and insulting conduct, as through fear of danger, since he believed that her lover Silius aspired to the throne. On that occasion he made a shameful and cowardly flight to the camp, doing nothing all the way, but asking whether his throne was secure”.
12h. Court intrigue Agrippina II
1)	AGRIPPINA II (THE YOUNGER) Daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina I (The Elder) Niece of Claudius She had one son: Lucius Domitius who would be known as (Tiberius Claudius) Nero. Nero was to become Claudius’ stepson, and his successor as emperor.
2)	Agrippina II was Claudius’ niece, as the daughter of his brother, Germanicus, and Agrippina (I), the granddaughter of Augustus. In AD 28 Tiberius had married her to a cousin, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, who was descended, (like Messalina) from Antonia the Elder (daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia, and the older sister of Antonia Minor). In December AD 37 they had a son, Lucius Domitius, who would become the emperor, Nero. By AD 48 Agrippina II was free to remarry: Gn. Domitius was dead, as was her second husband, Gnaeus Sallustius Crispus Passienus. As we have seen (12g) her presence on the horizon may have led Messalina to seek out Silius for some sort of protection or less likely, a political conspiracy to remove Claudius.
3)	Agrippina was an energetic and ambitious woman; Messalina feared that she was scheming to take her place, as she soon did (Tac. Ann. 11. 12; Dio 60. 33). No sooner was Messalina dead than did Claudius marry Agrippina II (Dio 60. 31.8; 32-33). * Despite allegations that Agrippina had seduced him, theirs was a political marriage. As the daughter of Germanicus (Julian clan) she too would bring prestige to the Principate, and she would also be acceptable to the armies as the daughter of Gemanicus. *Claudius had restored her from exile: Caligula-her brother- had exiled her in AD 39 upon learning of the conspiracy, involving her brother-in-law, Lepidus.
4)	Sebasteoin relief in Aphrodisias (Turkey): Agrippina and Claudius clasp hands, a gesture of marital concordia; the corn stalk in her left hand is a symbol of the prosperity of the Roman Empire.
5)	The impediment of incest-she was his niece- was removed when Claudius persuaded the senate to make it legal for a man to marry his brother’s daughter, and they married in AD 49 (Tac. 12. 6; Suet. Claud. 26. 3; Dio 60. 31. 6). Agrippina would receive all the honors that Messalina had received, including the title of Augusta, and a colony named after her, Colonia Agrippinensis, the present-day Cologne (Tacitus 12. 26–7). She appeared in public in a golden cloak, and sat in state with Claudius to receive homage from Caratacus, the defeated British chieftain* (Tac.12.37;12.56; Plin. NH 33.19). When she married Claudius, Nero was ten, three years older than Britannicus. *Caratacus had been brought to Rome for Claudius’ triumph, earlier in AD 49; he escaped execution afterwards, and was allowed to live in Rome, on account of a speech he delivered to Claudius, demonstrating his bravery.
6)	Like Messalina, Agrippina was accused of orchestrating the destruction of prominent members of the imperial family. She accused Lucius Junius Silanus, the fiancé of Claudius’ daughter (Claudia) Octavia, of incest and drove him to suicide. This left Octavia free to be betrothed to Agrippina’s son, Nero (Dio 60. 31-33 Tac.12.3-4; Suet. Claud. 27. 2). When Claudius adopted Nero in AD 50, he changed his name to include the Claudian cognomen Nero, and a new succession plan was implemented, at Agrippina’s urging (Tac.12.26). Claudius now had two sons, and Nero, as the older son, was first in line for the throne. * his name was Lucius Domitius, after his biological father
7)	Sebasteoin relief in Aphrodisias Agrippina crowns her son, Nero with a laurel wreath. Agrippina carries a cornucopia, the symbol of good fortune and prosperity, and Nero wears the cuirass (body armor) and cloak of a Roman commander.
8)	Agrippina II and Claudius
a)	 The historical tradition makes Agrippina II responsible for maneuvering Nero to the throne, but the arrangement was also in Claudius’ interest. An extra heir, one several years closer to coming of age than Britannicus, provided protection. Nero was awarded adult status early, and received the toga virilis of manhood, when he was only thirteen. (Claudia) Octavia was adopted into another family in order make the marriage between her and Nero (now siblings) possible, and they were married in AD 53 (Tac. Ann. 12. 8-9; 12. 22). Nero was promoted by Claudius at Agrippina’s behest (Tac. 12. 25-26; Tac. 12. 58; Dio 60. 32-33)
b)	 Like Messalina, Agrippina grew impatient to get her son on the throne. Britannicus was getting older, and he was scheduled to receive the toga virilis in AD 54. When this took place Nero would no longer be Claudius’ only adult son. A rumor circulated that Claudius had begun to regret his marriage to Agrippina II and the prominence he had given to Nero. He may even have planned to make Nero and Britannicus joint heirs, for he entrusted both to the protection of the senate, presumably in anticipation of his own death. Claudius now sixty-three, died on October 13, AD 54, allegedly at the hands of Agrippina.
c)	 Tac. Ann. 12. 64 “Disquieted by a remark let fall by Claudius in his cups, that it was his destiny first to suffer and finally to punish the infamy of his wives, she determined to act and speedily.” Suet. Claud. 43 Towards the end of his life, he had shown some plain signs of repentance for his marriage with Agrippina and his adoption of Nero; for when his freedmen expressed their approval of a trial in which he had the day before condemned a woman for adultery, he declared that it had been his destiny also to have wives who were all unchaste, but not unpunished; and shortly afterwards meeting Britannicus, he hugged him close and urged him to grow up and receive from his father an account of all that he had done, adding in Greek, ‘He who dealt the wound will heal it.’ When he expressed his intention of giving Britannicus the gown of man-hood, since his stature justified it though he was still young and immature, he added: ‘That the Roman people may at last have a genuine Caesar.’
d)	 Stories of Claudius’ death vary, but they implicate Agrippina II. Dio. 60. 34: he never regained consciousness. Tac. Ann. 12. 66-67: the poison was evacuated, and he had to be given an additional dose. Suetonius 44: Agrippina put poison in mushrooms, or had a eunuch do it at a banquet for the Augustales. Agrippina did not announce his death until noon, an hour that astrologers had declared propitious. The delay provided time to arrange for the praetorian guard to salute Nero as imperator, and in the meantime, Agrippina kept Britannicus and his sister out of public view (Dio 60. 35. 1- 2; Tac. 12. 69).
e)	 Tacitus Ann. 12.66 “Under the weight of anxiety, his health broke down, and he left for Sinuessa, to renovate his strength by the gentle climate and the medicinal springs. At once, Agrippina long resolved on murder, eager to seize the proffered occasion, and at no lack for assistants sought advice upon the type of poison. With a rapid and drastic drug, the crime, she feared, would be obvious: if she decided for a slow and wasting preparation, Claudius, face to face with his end, and aware of her treachery, might experience a return of affection for his son. What commended itself was something obscure, which would derange his faculties while postponing his dissolution. An artist in this domain was selected, a woman by the name of Locusta, lately sentenced on a poisoning charge, and long retained as part of the stock-intrade of absolutism. Her ingenuity supplied a potion, administered by the eunuch Halotus, whose regular duty was to bring in and taste the dishes.”
9)	Claudius was buried with funeral honors the same as those of Augustus. The senate quickly declared him divine: Dio 60. 35. 1- 2-; Tac. 12. 69: Suet. Claud. 45; Sen. Apoc. 2. 2, 12. 1. A pamphlet soon circulated in the court. The Apocolocyntosis (“Pumpkinification”), a political satire allegedly by Seneca, ridiculed the inconsistency of Claudius’ divinity with his ineptitude and cruelty (Dio 60. 35. 3). Not surprisingly, it was performed early in Nero’s reign.
10)	Dio 60. 35. 3. “Seneca himself had composed a work he called the Pumpkinification, a word formed on the analogy of deification; and his brother is credited with saying a great deal in one short sentence. 4. In as much as the public executioners were accustomed to drag the bodies of those executed in the prison to the Forum with large hooks, and from there hauled them to the river, he remarked that Claudius had been raised to heaven with a hook. Nero, too, has left us a remark not unworthy of record. He declared mushrooms to be the food of the gods, since Claudius by means of the mushroom had become a god.”
11)	“Claudius had enlarged the empire and had behaved in a way that avoided some of the excesses of Tiberius and Caligula before him, and of Nero, who would follow, and it became desirable to reconcile the contradictions of his legacy. If it could be decided that he was a tool in the hands of his wives and freedmen, his cruelty could be ascribed to their influence. The unseemly figure that remained was comparatively harmless.” D. Hurley
Chapter 13: Nero 
13a. Quinquennium neronis 
1)	Agrippina II = Great granddaughter of Augustus; Granddaughter of Julia; daughter of  Agrippina I; sister of Caligula; wife of Claudius; mother of Nero
2)	Accession and Early Reign: First year of the reign 
3)	AD 54-59 Quinquennium Neronis : The first five years were the best of the reign, in spite of the fact that during this period Nero committed fratricide (the murder of his brother, Britannicus AD 55) and matricide (the murder of his mother, Agrippina II AD 59) 
4)	Declension into Tyranny Uxoricide the murder of his wife, (Claudia) Octavia; the murder (?) or death of Burrus; marriage to Poppaea Sabina, AD 62
5)	AD 64 Great Fire of Rome abuse of Christians (?) AD 65
6)	Foreign Policy: Wars and Provincial Administration
a)	Campaigns in Armenia and the Parthians (AD 55-66); the coronation of Tiridates AD 66 
b)	Southwest Africa 
c)	The Black Sea
d)	Britain and the Revolt of Boudicca (AD 60/61)
7)	The End of the Reign: Conspiracies, Revolts and Death
a)	AD 65 Conspiracy of Piso AD 65 Death of Seneca AD 65 Death of Lucan AD 65 Death of Petronius
b)	AD 66 The Conspiracy of Annius Vinicianus and death of Corbulo
c)	AD 67/68 The Revolt of Vindex; defeat of Vindex by Rufus; successful bid for throne by Galba
d)	AD 68 Death of Nero
8)	We have seen the following trends, and they will culminate with the reign of Nero: 
a)	The decline of the senate and the elimination of the aristocracy and members of the imperial family, through treason and conspiracy trials. 
b)	The extension of control through the promotion of equestrians. 
c)	Increased militarization: the emperor’s power rested uniquely on the armies, and he had to earn and maintain their respect and loyalty. The army not only ensured the emperor’s control in Rome, but it also kept peace and prosperity in the provinces. Nero’s neglect of the armies (and his failure to pay them), would in the end, lead to his down-fall and death.
9)	ACCESSION & EARLY REIGN 
a)	In AD 54 Claudius died. Poisoned by Agrippina II. The young Nero, not even 17, was elevated to the throne by the praetorian guard. 
b)	Nero the Artist Nero had no experience, and little or no interest in ruling. However, Nero had artistic leanings and a great interest in architecture. In fact, he promoted and patronized an architectural revolution, afforded by the development of the technology of concrete. Nero also wrote poems, of which fragments survive, and he loved the stage.
c)	A student of voice and harp, he is said to have given private performances as singer, artist actor and poet. 
10)	The Quinquennium Neronis AD 54-59. According to the emperor Trajan, the first five years of Nero’s reign, the quinquennium Neronis, were the best of the principate. Nero stayed out of trouble by (mostly) following the advice and the instructions of Seneca, his mentor, teacher and “handler,” whom Agrippina II had hired to educate the adolescent Nero.* That said, Nero committed the murder of his stepbrother, Britannicus and his mother, during the quinquennium Neronis (see 13 b).
11)	Seneca was Nero's advisor. Within hours of Claudius' death, Nero claimed his power in a well-crafted speech to the Praetorian Guard. The speech, which promised loyal soldiers a huge bonus, was written for him by Seneca.The inauguration of Nero was a happy event; his reign started out well enough.
12)	In a second speech to the senate, carefully prepared by Seneca and well delivered by Nero, he promised the senate:
a)	to follow policies of Augustus.	
b)	to respect the powers and prerogatives of senate.
c)	to keep for himself the command of armies.
d)	He also promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate (Claudius had taken liberties with the courts).
14)	His chief advisors were: Agrippina Il his mother Afranius Burus, the praetorian-prefect. Claudius' treasurer, Pallas Seneca wrote his speeches, sounded out the senate and assumed other responsibilities. He also composed the eulogy for Claudius, which Nero gave at his funeral.
15)	Agrippina the Younger: stage mother and "optima mater" At first Nero let his mother receive embassies, set foreign policy and portray herself with him on imperial coinage.She continued under Nero to eliminate anyone who stood in the way of her authority or the authority of her son.
16)	The sources report Agrippina II had been busy clearing the way of any opposition for Nero from the moment she married Claudius in AD 49. She murdered Junius Silanus, the great grandson of Augustus, to whom (Claudia) Octavia, Claudius’ daughter, had been betrothed, so that Nero could marry her. Agrippina may also have orchestrated the elimination of two of Claudius’ freedmen ministers, Callistus and Narcissus, who had supported Claudius’ son, Britannicus, and may have been planning to compromise her position in the court. Seneca and Burrus soon grew tired of her and tried to stop her; and in AD 55 they told Nero that he was old enough to ignore her. So began the discord between Nero and Agrippina II.

13b. Fratricide and Matricide 
1)	Alienation of Nero and Agrippina II: Fratricide and Matricide. Nero fuelled more familial discord with his rebellious behavior, and he was bored with his wife (Claudia) Octavia, whom he had married (on Agrippina’s orders) in AD 53. Conflict between mother and son grew when Agrippina learned that Nero planned to divorce Octavia and take up with a Greek freedwoman, and servant of Octavia, by the name of Acte. 
2)	In AD 55 Agrippina became angry, and accused Nero of ingratitude, disgracing the imperial family, and being degenerate. In response to the scolding, Nero upped the ante, and dismissed Pallas, who had supported his succession (and was allegedly Agrippina’s secret lover). Now Agrippina threatened to depose Nero and support the legitimacy of Claudius’ son, Britannicus. As a result, Nero began to regard Britannicus as a real threat, and decided to remove him permanently.
3)	Fratricide: In AD 55 Argrippina’s threats drove Nero to plan the death or Britannicus (by poison), removing a rival to the throne. The source report that Nero used the same poisoner who had been hired to murder Claudius. To trick the food taster: a hot drink was served to Britannicus; the positioned water was added to his drunk when he complained it was too hot. Britannicus collapsed, foaming at the mouth and died instantly. Nero claimed it was epilepsy, which may also have been case. 
4)	Tacitus Ann. 13.16 “It was customary for the imperial princes to sit during their meals with other nobles of the same age, in the sight of their kinsfolk, at a table of their own, furnished somewhat frugally. There Britannicus was dining, and as what he ate and drank was always tested by the taste of a select attendant, the following device was contrived, that the usage might not be dropped or the crime betrayed by the death of both prince and attendant. A cup as yet harmless, but extremely hot and already tasted, was handed to Britannicus; then, on his refusing it because of its warmth, poison was poured in with some cold water, and this so penetrated his entire frame that he lost alike voice and breath. There was a stir among the company; some, taken by surprise, ran hither and thither, while those whose discernment was keener, remained motionless, with their eyes fixed on Nero, who, as he still reclined in seeming unconsciousness, said that this was a common occurrence: from a periodical epilepsy, with which Britannicus had been afflicted from his earliest infancy, and that his sight and senses would gradually return. As for Agrippina, her terror and confusion, though her countenance struggled to hide it, so visibly appeared, that she was clearly just as ignorant as was Octavia, Britannicus’ own sister. She saw, in fact, that she was robbed of her only remaining refuge, and that here was a precedent for parricide. Even Octavia, in spite of her youthful inexperience, had learnt to hide her grief, her affection, and indeed every emotion.”
5)	The narratives of the story are found in Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio. The main outlines are inconsistent in some details, but they share common themes: 
a)	Nero was angry at Agrippina II for meddling in his love life. 
b)	He concocted a collapsible boat or ceiling as a deathtrap to drown and/or crush her to death. 
c)	Agrippina survived and swam home, and was subsequently murdered by Nero’s henchmen, and posthumously convicted of treason
6)	In AD 58 or early 59 Nero became involved with Poppaea Sabina. Since Agrippina had threatened him with consequences if he divorced Octavia and remarried, Nero laid plans to eliminate her. Tacitus (14.1-3) writes he considered poisoning or stabbing her, but felt it was too risky. Suetonius (34.2) reports that he tried to poison her, then he hung a collapsible ceiling over her bed to crush her to death; when this failed, he built a self-sinking “deathtrap” boat. Cassius Dio (62.13) writes that Nero prepared a ship. Although aware of the plot, Agrippina went out on the boat and she was nearly crushed by a lead ceiling, but managed to swim to shore. When the news of her survival reached Nero, he sent three assassins to stab her to death.
7)	To get her on the boat, Nero had invited Agrippina to join him at a festival in Baiae. When it was time for her to leave, he gave her a boat to ferry her up the coast. The boat was supposed to collapse and crush her to death, but the plan failed: The deck of the ship fell in, yet, instead of killing Agrippina, it crushed one of her attendants.
8)	The hull had been crafted to break apart, but it failed to do, so the rowers tried to overturn the ship but the effort fell short. Agrippina and a second attendant, Acerronia, swam free, but Acerronia "rather unwisely" (Tacitus) kept screaming that she was Agrippina and needed help. The rowers rushed over and bashed her head in with their oars. The real Agrippina slipped away and was picked up by a fishing boat and deposited on shore.
9)	When the news of Agrippina's survival reached Nero he sent assassins to stab her to death. Dio Cassius: Her last words, uttered as the assassin was about to strike were: "Smite my womb and destroy what had given birth to so abominable a son."
10)	Tacitus Annals 14.9: “So far, the accounts concur. Whether Nero inspected the corpse of his mother and expressed approval of her figure is a statement which some affirm, and some deny.” Suetonius 34. 4: “Trustworthy authorities add still more gruesome details: that he hurried off to view the corpse, handled her limbs, criticising some and commending others, and that becoming thirsty meanwhile, he took a drink.” Dio 42.14. 2: “Nero, when informed that she was dead, would not believe it, since the deed was so monstrous that he was overwhelmed by incredulity; he therefore desired to behold the victim of his crime with his own eyes.” So, he laid bare her body, looked her all over, and inspected her wounds, finally uttering a remark far more abominable even than the murder. His words were: “I did not know I had so beautiful a mother.”
11)	Medieval Accounds underline the desecration of Agrippina’s corpse at the behest of Nero. In Medieval times the illustrated manuscripts display the dissection of Agrippina’s body at the behest of Nero: “Nero looking on, as the body of his mother Agrippina is disembowelled, in order to see the place where he was conceived and praising her beauty.” Harlian Collection of MS: no. 4425 1490-1500 British Museum.
12)	To deflect guilt from himself for the crime, Nero generated alternative facts: After the botched boating accident, Nero turned to Seneca for damage control, and Seneca set to work. Writing in the voice of the emperor, he composed a letter to the Senate explaining what had happened: Hungry for power, Agrippina had planned a coup. Once the plot was revealed, she took her own life. The shipwreck was a sign that the gods themselves had tried to intervene on the emperor’s behalf.
13)	The “official” response to the letter was jubilation. Tacitus (Ann 14.12) reports that there was a rivalry among the senators in celebrating Nero’s narrow escape from danger. They held games, made offerings at shrines, and proposed that Agrippina’s birthday should be classed among the inauspicious days” (i.e. holidays). To which Nero replied: “That I am safe, neither, as yet, do I believe, nor do I rejoice” (Quintilian 8. 5, quoting Seneca’s letter). This statement was meant to imply that indeed the emperor had been in great danger (!)
14)	What was the immediate motive for Nero to murder his mother? Did Poppaea Sabina provoke him? Nero was early on attracted to Poppaea Sabina, the wife of Otho, a friend and political ally, who would briefly rule Rome during the civil war following Nero’s death. Dio reports (62. 11-12) that Poppaea “persuaded Nero to get rid of Agrippina, alleging she was plotting against him.” However, Nero did not marry Poppaea until AD 62, three years after Agrippina’s death.
15)	Rubellius Plautus It has been argued that Nero’s decision to kill Agrippina may have been prompted by Agrippina’s threats to put Rubellius Plautus, Nero’s second cousin, and the great grandson of Tiberius, on the throne. Agrippina the Younger allegedly induced him to rebel against Nero as early as AD 55, but the allegation was suppressed (Tac. Ann 13 19). However, in AD 60 Nero sent him out to Asia (to get him out of Rome) because he regarded him as a threat because of his Julio Claudian connections and the fact that as a Stoic philosopher, he opposed the tyranny of Nero in principle (Tac. Ann. 14. 22). And in AD 62 the same year he murdered Agrippina, Nero had Plautus murdered in Asia, and confiscated his estates in Africa on suspicion of conspiring against the emperor (Dio 62.14; Tac. Ann 14. 57-59).
16)	Rubellius Plautus, as the son of Rubellius Blandus and Julia, the granddaughter of Tiberius, was a rival of Nero (Tac. 13.19.3). His parents were married in AD 33; he was about three years older than Nero. There were rumors in Rome that in AD 62 Plautus was in negotiations with Gn. Domitius Corbulo, Nero’s general, based in the eastern Mediterranean; according to the rumors, Asia had revolted in support of Rubellius Plautus. A party that had been sent out to oversee Plautus’ execution had even gone over to the rebels (Tac. 14.58.1). All this, Tacitus rejects, because he (as it turns out) correctly believed Plautus was the victim of Nero’s tyranny. Plautus’ freedman reached Asia before the executioner with the following instructions from Plautus' father-in-law, Lucius Antistius Vetus: “Fight! If you defeat the execution party of sixty (a maniple commanded by a centurion), “there will be time before others can arrive from Rome, in which anything can happen, even war. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by resisting.” (Tac.14. 58. 31). But Plautus was unmoved by his father-in-law’s words, whether, Tacitus suggests, unarmed and in exile, he saw no resource for resistance, or he was tired of dubious prospects, or out of love for wife and children; in any event, “he wished to placate the emperor by removing himself as a challenge to his security.”(Tac. 14. 59. 1).
17)	Tacitus acknowledges other sources that give a different version of the story: he says, “there are those who stated that fresh couriers had arrived from his fatherin-law with news that no drastic measures were pending” (14. 59. 2-3). Does that mean that Antistius’ was tricked? The same sources reported that two teachers of (Stoic) philosophy, Coeranus and the famous Musonius Rufus, advised Plautus to have the courage to choose suicide instead of life, in uncertainty and fear. But Tacitus says he will not vouch for any of the accounts (14. 59. 3). In any case, the executioner arrived and found Rubellius Plautus exercising, and he decapitated him in the presence of his wife (Tac.14.59.3; 16. 10). His head was carried back to Rome, and Nero, seeing it, allegedly said to himself, “Why were you afraid of a man with such a long nose?” (Tac. 14. 59. 4; Dio, 62. 14.1); Suetonius, does not mention Rubellius Plautus or the grisly incident

13c. Tyranny uxoricide 
1)	Decline into Tyranny AD 59-68; Whatever the cause, the murder of Agrippina was a turning point for Nero, that marks the beginning of a new phase of decline. Nero also began to distance himself from Seneca. “After the emperor sidelined his old tutor, came tellingly, what might be called the novennium Neronis horribilis -the nine terrible years. During this time, Rome drifted toward chaos as Nero devoted himself to building ever more opulent palaces and competing in the classical version of the Eurovision contest.”
2)	AD 62 Nero Removes more obstacles: In AD 62 Nero divorced (Claudia) Octavia, his wife, so he could marry his mistress, Poppaea Sabina, who was now pregnant with his child. It is worth noting that the death of Nero’s praetorian prefect, Afranius Burrus, who had opposed the marriage, may have been a murder. Seneca tried to retire from the court, although Nero made this difficult and dangerous for him.
3)	Uxoricide: Despite popular demonstrations, in AD 62 Nero, allegedly at the behest of Poppaea, divorced Octavia on charges of adultery and sterility. Octavia, a most tragic Roman empress, became a victim of her birth, her family, palace intrigues and her husband. Her marriage to Nero in AD 53 had been mutually distasteful and had not produced an heir. Nero banished her to Pandateria, where she would be executed; as proof of her death, her head was sent to Rome, where all images of her were removed or defaced. (Sources: Tacitus' (14.60-65) Suetonius Nero (35.1-3). Pseudo-Seneca, Octavia: (history play)
4)	The first charges of adultery were made when she was in Rome, before she was banished; her slaves had been forced to bring charges against her. Since no one believed the charges-the people adored Octavia- Nero charged her with sterility, and sent her down to Misenum, where Nero bribed the prefect of the fleet (allegedly the same who had executed Agrippina II), to charge her with adultery. Tac. Ann. Book 14, 63-64: “Nero, for his part, announced by an edict that Octavia had seduced the prefect in the hope of gaining the co-operation of his squadron; and that, conscious of her infidelities, she had procured abortion; he failed to remember his recent charge of sterility!”
5)	(Claudia) Octavia Coin from Perinthos, Thrace. OKTAOYIA ΣEBAΣTH, diademed and draped bust right / HΡA ΠEΡINΘIΩN, Hera of Samos standing left. The people of Rome wanted Octavia recalled and staged riots. Intimidated by the masses, Nero publicly “agreed” to remarry her, however privately he signed her death warrant. A few days later, she was bound, her veins were opened, and she was suffocated in a hot steam bath. Her head was cut off and sent to Poppaea; her murder shocked Rome.
6)	Tacitus Book 14. 63-64 63. “No woman in exile ever presented a more pitiful spectacle to the eye of the beholder. There were yet some who recollected the banishment of Agrippina by Tiberius; The more recent memory of Julia's* expulsion by Claudius still dwelt in the minds of men. But to these the maturity of life had come; they had seen some little happiness and could soften the cruelty of the present by recalling the brighter fortunes of the past. To Octavia, first of all, her day of marriage had been tantamount to a day of burial, entering as she did a house where mourning alone awaited her, where her father was snatched away by poison, to be followed at once by her brother. Then had come the maid, more potent than her mistress, and Poppaea turning bride, only to destroy a wife; last of all, an accusation more bitter than any doom.” *Julia Livilla, youngest child of Germanicus and Agrippina; exiled by her brother Caligula in 37 AD; recalled by Claudius at outset of his reign, then, at the instigation of Messalina, banished again on a charge of adultery with Seneca, and shortly afterwards put to death (Dio. 60.4.8)
7)	64. “And so this girl, in the twentieth year of her age, surrounded by centurions and soldiers, cut off already from life by foreknowledge of her fate, still lacked the peace of death. There followed an interval of a few days; then she was ordered to die, though she protested she was husbandless now, a sister and nothing more, evoking the Germanici* whose blood they shared, and, in the last resort, the name of Agrippina, in whose lifetime she had supported a wifehood, unhappy enough but still not fatal. She was tied fast with cords, and the veins were opened in each limb: then, as the blood, arrested by terror, ebbed too slowly, she was suffocated in the bath heated to an extreme temperature. As a further and more hideous cruelty, the head was amputated and carried to Rome, where it was viewed by Poppaea. For all these things offerings were decreed to the temples; how often must those words be said? Let all who make their acquaintance with the history of that period in my narrative, or that of others, take so much for granted: as often as the emperor ordered an exile or a murder, so often was a thanksgiving addressed to Heaven. And what formerly betokened prosperity was now a symbol of public calamity. Nevertheless, where a senatorial decree achieved a novelty in adulation or a last word in self-abasement, I shall not pass it by in silence.” *Descendants of Drusus I: Germanicus, Claudius her side of the family
8)	“After the death of Britannicus and then of Agrippina, Octavia was the sole remnant of the Claudian house. She was the last to leave the stage. Her lonely isolation was the theme of a tragedy (Octavia) written by an unknown playwright not long after the death of Nero.” D. Hurley The play had been attributed to Seneca, but more recently based on content and stylistic evidence, it is dated to the early Flavian period. No one has established the identity of the author. However, Tacitus is believed to have used it in his narrative about the fate of Octavia. The “Octavia” is the only Latin history play (fabula praetexta) to survive in its entirety. It compresses the final events of Octavia’s life into three days in June of AD 62.
9)	In AD 65 Nero kicked Sabina Poppaea to death while she was pregnant; Suetonius and Tacitus insinuate it was deliberate; Dio allows it may not have been intentional.
10)	Epitome of Dio 62. 27-28: on Sabina’s death, her vanity and Nero’s response to her death; Nero’s favorite after her death is a eunuch. “Sabina also perished at this time through an act of Nero's; either accidentally or intentionally he had leaped upon her with his feet while she was pregnant. The extremes of luxury indulged in by this Sabina I will indicate in the briefest terms. She caused gilded shoes to be put on the mules that drew her and caused five hundred asses that had recently foaled to be milked daily that she might bathe in their milk. For she bestowed the greatest pains on the beauty and brilliancy of her person, and this is why, when she noticed in a mirror one day that her appearance was not comely, she prayed that she might die before she passed her prime. Nero missed her so greatly after her death that on learning of a woman who resembled her, he at first sent for her and kept her. But later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, to be castrated, since he, too, resembled Sabina, and he used him in every way like a wife. In due time, though already “married” to Pythagoras, a freedman, he formally “married” Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract; and the Romans as well as others, publicly celebrated their wedding.”
11)	Death of Poppaea Italian School 18th century
12)	19th c. painting by Emilio Vasari maybe meant to evoke Nero and Sporus. Suetonius Nero 28: “He castrated the boy Sporus and tried to make a woman of him; and he married him with all the usual ceremonies, including a dowry and a bridal veil, took him to his home attended by a great throng and treated him as his wife. And the witty jest that someone made is still current, that it would have been well for the world if Nero's father, Domitius, had had that kind of wife. This Sporus, decked out with the finery of the empresses and riding in a litter, he took with him to the courts and marts of Greece, and later at Rome through the Street of the Images, fondly kissing him from time to time.”
13)	AD 62 Nero’s Secret Police; When Nero’ praetorian prefect, Burrus had “died” Nero took on as his political clients and henchmen: i. a former fish monger and criminal named Ofonius Tigellinus ii. a horse breeder named Faenius Rufus. Both were made praetorian prefect and mandated to track down plots against the emperor.
14)	Tac. 14. 51 “For the Caesar had appointed two commanders to the praetorian cohorts: Faenius Rufus, commended by the favor of the crowd, as he superintended the provisioning of the capital without profit to himself; and Ofonius Tigellinus in whose case the attractions were the licentiousness of his past and his infamy. Neither belied his known habits: Tigellinus took the firmer hold over the mind of the prince and was made free of his most intimate debauches. Rufus enjoyed an excellent character with the people and the troops and labored under that disadvantage in his relations with Nero.” Tigellinus also hated Seneca, and advised Nero that adherence to Seneca’s stoic philosophy showed a seditious attitude toward the emperor (Tac. Ann. 14. 57; 16. 21–22).
15)	With Burrus and Seneca’s influence gone, any freedom that the senate had enjoyed disappeared. “The abysmal Tigellinus was now the foremost advisor of the still young emperor, a man whose origin was from the lowest levels of society and who can accurately be described as criminal in outlook and action.” G. Fagan

13d. Great fire xians 
1)	Great Fire of Rome AD 64
a)	(Cassius Dio 62. 16-18; Suetonius, Nero 16; Tacitus, Ann. 15. 38-44). In 64 a fire broke out in the slums at the east end of the Circus Maximus between the Palatine and Caelian Hills; it spread quickly and destroyed more than half of Rome. Nero was away at Antium at the time, but returned immediately and acted decisively, organizing relief for the victims of the fire. After the fire ended and the debris was removed, Nero spared no expense from the privy-purse (though he also used confiscations) for rebuilding and restoration, aimed at making Rome more fire-proof. Nero also passed laws regulating building aimed at fire prevention.
b)	 Nevertheless Nero was suspected of having deliberately started the fire so that he could construct an enormous pleasure palace, the Domus Aurea at the foot of Palatine.
c)	 Rumors spread that Nero had played lyre and had sung an aria while all of Rome was burning.
d)	 Nero found a scapegoat in the Christians of Rome to deflect guilt. Tac. 15. 44: “finding Christians a detestable sect, he forced them to confess to charges of arson.” He smeared them with pitch and used them as human torches to light the games and entertainments in the amphitheater, where they were condemned to the beasts. Suet. 16: “Punishment was inflicted on the Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition.”
e)	 Nero may have blamed the Christians because they were living near the place where the fire started: the eastern part of the Circus Maximus. The early Christians lived among the Jewish population of Rome. Nero could not have punished the Jews of Rome: there were thousands of them, but the Christians were an easy target. It has been argued that the Christians may in fact have rejoiced in the fire, because they believed that the destruction of Rome was a sign that Christ had returned. Presumably they responded enthusiastically when they saw the evil and worldly city of Rome in flames. Tacitus also reports that some of them pleaded guilty.
f)	Tacitus 15. 44 “But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called “Chrestians” by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.” Cassius Dio 62.18 “While the whole population was in this state of mind and many, crazed by the disaster, were leaping into the very flames, Nero ascended to the roof of the palace, from which there was the best general view of the greater part of the conflagration, and assuming the lyre-player's garb, he sang the “Capture of Troy,” as he styled the song himself, though to the enemies of the spectators it was the Capture of Rome.”
g)	The reliability of Tacitus’s account of the persecution has been questioned over the years. Many scholars have argued that his version of events is not legitimate, or that the passage itself was not written by Tacitus, but rather inserted much later by a scholiast (scholar or editor) associated with the church. E.g. Brent Shaw, “The Myth of the Neronian Persecution,” Journal of Roman Studies 105 (2015):73-100,” who suggests that the so-called Neronian persecution never actually occurred. However others believe the passage of Tacitus is credible. E.g. Christopher Jones, “The Historicity of the Neronian Persecution: A Response to Brent Shaw, ” New Testament Studies 63.1 (2017) : 146-152, who argues against Shaw, and claims that there is no reason to doubt Tacitus’ narrative. The tradition of Nero and the persecution of early Christians by Nero: Tacitus 15. 44; Suet. 16; Tertullian Apology V. 3-4; Ad nationes I.7.8; Clement 5.4-7; Eusebius II. 22.1-8; 25. 1-5 4th c.; Melito in Eusebius. IV. 36. 9.
h)	 The execution of the Christians in a circus on the Vatican hill, where Nero’s family owned a villa and a park, would have been a grotesque entertainment to the Romans; (in fact forcing Christians to die in the amphitheater was considered a cruel an unusual punishment). Tacitus’ remark that “they were covered with the skins of beasts and torn by dogs” suggests that several Christians were forced to be actors in a mythological living picture (a re-enactment called a tableau vivant). The myth was probably the death of Actaeon, the hunter who was eaten by his own dogs.
i)	Traditionally, it is believed that Nero killed the Apostles Peter and Paul. In this relief of Trials of Peter and Paul, (Paolo Romano, ca. 1415-1470 ) the 15th c. portrait of Nero is based on a well-known Roman portrait of Nero.
j)	In Acts (27.1-28) Paul dies by decapitation. In the Teachings of the Apostles, Paul confronts Nero and then leaves him there-we don’t hear about him after this. According to the Apocryphal Acts of St Peter, (Acts 8. 9-24 ) Peter was crucified upside down (for his faith) because he said he did not feel worthy to be crucified upright, like Christ; according to the Teachings of the Apostles, Peter died by the sword. This early 16th painting depicts the struggle between Simon Magus and Peter and Paul in front of Nero at Rome at the right, and the upside down crucifixion of Peter at the left; Simon had tried to win the favor of Nero with magic but was thwarted by the Apostles in a dispute.

13e. Foreign policy east Armenia 
1)	Foreign Policy, Wars and Provincial Administration: the eastern frontier. Nero’s foreign policy was fairly good, if not consistent. He generally maintained peace and prosperity in the provinces, and mostly chose good governors, some of whom became his victims. Some provincial procurators and governors abused provincial subjects, and there were rebellions in Britain and Judaea. However, over time Nero neglected the legions, and he stopped paying them. Nero had spent huge sums of money on refurbishing Rome after the Great Fire, which depleted the treasury and eventually alienated the armies.
2)	In four areas order was threatened: Britain, Armenia, Judaea and Gaul (Germania Inferior) 
3)	1. The Kingdom of Greater Armenia and the Parthians: Cassius Dio 62. 19-26; 63. 4-5; Tacitus Annals 13. 31-58. 15. 24-33.
4)	After Augustus recovered the Roman standards from the Parthians Rome had been able to keep friendly kings in Greater Armenia.Claudius had kept this up, but toward the end of his reign dynastic problems in Parthia worked against Rome:
5)	Corbulo and the Armenian Campaign AD 54-63. In AD 54 Nero appointed Gn. Domitius Corbulo to execute a settlement policy in the Kingdom of Greater Armenia and the Kingdom of Parthia. The mandate was aimed at maintaining peace, with military force, if necessary, on the eastern frontier and installing a Roman friendly vassal king on the throne of Armenia. However, the Parthian king Vologeses had installed his brother, Tiridates on the Armenian throne at the end of Claudius’ reign (12 f, 15-21). Essentially, in mandating Corbulo to threaten Vologeses with the prospect of war, if he did not follow Rome’s nominal say in who ruled Armenia, Nero was following the policy in the east, of coercion and diplomacy, going back to Augustus. Nero may have had a more ambitious arrangement in mind, but Corbulo’s military successes in Armenia allowed him to forge a settlement that was consistent with the Augustan model. 
6)	In AD 54 Nero appointed Gn. Domitius Corbulo to execute a settlement policy in the Kingdom of Greater Armenia and the Kingdom of Parthia. The mandate was aimed at maintaining peace, with military force, if necessary, on the eastern frontier and installing a Roman friendly vassal king on the throne of Armenia. However, the Parthian king Vologeses had installed his brother, Tiridates on the Armenian throne at the end of Claudius’ reign (12 f, 15-21). Essentially, in mandating Corbulo to threaten Vologeses with the prospect of war, if he did not follow Rome’s nominal say in who ruled Armenia, Nero was following the policy in the east, of coercion and diplomacy, going back to Augustus. Nero may have had a more ambitious arrangement in mind, but Corbulo’s military successes in Armenia allowed him to forge a settlement that was consistent with the Augustan model
7)	As mentioned, in 54 Corbulo was appointed by Nero to oversee the settlement policy in Armenia, and if necessary, command against Parthia (Tac. Ann. 13, 6). His official appointment at the outset is disputed. He had a military command in Armenia, but his title is not known. However soon after his deployment, he was appointed Military governor (Legate) of Cappadocia and Galatia. The chronology of the war is disputed. Corbulo spent two and a half years training his troops for the campaign; and in the first years, no major battles were fought (Ann. 13, 34, 4 ff). But in 58 the war began in earnest. During this period Vologeses was detained by the revolt of his son (Vardanes); his brother, Tiridates remained in control of Armenia. In the spring of 58, while Vologeses was resisting a new revolt in Hyrcania, Corbulo urged Tiridates to appeal to Nero for the possession of his throne; he could continue to rule and Rome’s interests, reputation and nominal sovereignty would be secured (Tac.Ann. 13, 37). Tiridates, refused the offer and the war began. But after a successful campaign, in 58 Corbulo captured the Armenian capital, Artaxata. In the following year, 59 Corbulo captured Armenia’s second capital city, Tigranocerta. With the capture of these cities, the Kingdom of Greater Armenia was now controlled by Corbulo, and he expelled Tiridates from Armenia (Ann. 13, 41).
8)	Corbulo’s authority in the region is demonstrated by demands by local populations like the Hyrcanians,* who sent an embassy to ask for alliance with Rome against the tyranny of Vologeses. *(Hycania was a historical region south-east of the Caspian Sea in modern-day Iran and Turkmenistan).
9)	AD 60-61 In the following year (60), the Parthian king Tiridates attempted to recover Armenia by invasion from the east but was repulsed by Corbulo. When he heard the news of Corbulo’s successes, and the expulsion of Tiridates, Nero chose a Cappadocian prince Tigranes, and sent him out to rule Armenia; Corbulo left a garrison with Tigranes and went to his new appointment as Legate of Syria in place of Ummius Quadratus, who had died. However, Nero’s arrangement failed because in 61 Tigranes incited Vologeses to war. Corbulo sent two legions to support him, but he wrote to Nero asking him to exercise caution for he wanted a diplomatic solution rather than a war. He also requested more military support and a second commander to assist him in the defense of Armenia, because Syria was also in danger, and if Vologeses attacked Syria, as Legate he (Corbulo) should be there to defend his province. It has been argued that Corbulo’s actions reveal he did not think Tigranes, who had been named by Nero, was a suitable ruler of Armenia and as we have seen as early as 58, he proposed a diplomatic settlement in which Tiridates (whom Vologeses his brother, also wanted on the throne), could rule; Corbulo also wanted Nero to officially install Tiridates so that Rome could retain imperium over Armenia. Meanwhile, until he heard from Nero and the extra commander arrived with reinforcements, Corbulo made a truce with the Parthians, according to which both sides would withdraw their forces from Armenia. Tiridates followed the agreement and departed; Tigranes vanished; it was suspected that Corbulo had discreetly gotten rid of him (i.e., murdered him) (Ann. 15,6)
10)	AD 62 Caesennius Paetus was defeated at Rhandeia The sequence of events in Tacitus for 62 is a jumble. Corbulo wintered in Cappadocia before the arrival of Caesennius Paetus the second commander; Paetus arrived in the spring (of 61) and started his raid into Armenia in early winter of 62; he failed, and Corbulo had to rescue him. Just as Corbulo disapproved of Nero’s choice of Tigranes as a vassal king of Armenia, he was also not impressed with Nero’s appointment of Caesennius Paetus to command (as proconsul) in Armenia. Nero had typically appointed two incompetent partisans, (to whom he had given consulships in 61), to the two most important commands at this time: in the west Gaius Turpillianus, who was sent out to Britian after the Boudiccan revolt (13 f) to replace the Legate, Suetonius Paullinus; and in the east Caesennius Paetus who went to Armenia to “assist” Corbulo. In short, Paetus’ campaign was a disastrous failure. He took over the troops assigned to him without consulting Corbulo (Ann. 15, 6-17). He rushed into Armenia but had to withdraw because of supply shortages as winter began. Tacitus writes he composed pretentious exaggerated reports to Nero and then retreated and made his winter quarters at Rhandeia on the border of Cappadocia. Corbulo in the meantime confined his activities to the defense of the Euphrates, though he must have recognized the trouble that Paetus was in; Paetus had further weakened his position by sending the 5th legion to Pontus and by giving liberal furloughs to his troops. Vologeses took advantage of Paetus’ retreat, and attacked, laying siege to Rhandeia. Paetus was badly defeated in the conflict, and the eastern command was returned to Corbulo (Tac. Ann 15. 68; 10-17; 24). Paetus had begged Corbulo for assistance during the siege; Tacitus insinuates that Corbulo took his time despite the urgent pleas. And Corbulo rescued him; however, he refused to avenge him by invading Armenia, on the grounds that he had not received orders to do so.
11)	Tacitus 15. 17 1 The aftermath “Between the leaders followed a brief conversation, Corbulo complaining that his labor had been wasted, declared,“the campaign might have been settled by a Parthian flight.” Paetus replied that with each of them the position was quite uncompromised; they had only to turn the eagles around, join forces, and invade Armenia, now enfeebled by the withdrawal of Vologeses. Corbulo said “he had no orders to that effect from the emperor: only because he was moved by the danger of the legions had he left his province; and as the Parthian designs were quite uncertain, he would make his way back to Syria. Even so, he must pray for fortune to be at her kindest, if his infantry, out-worn by their long marches, were to come up with active cavalry, almost sure to outstrip him along level and easy ground.” Paetus then took up his winter quarters in Cappadocia: Vologeses sent emissaries to Corbulo, proposing that he should withdraw his posts across the Euphrates and make the river as formerly a line of delimitation. Corbulo demanded that Armenia should be similarly cleared of the various scattered garrisons. In the long run, the king (Vologeses) gave way: Corbulo destroyed his defensive works beyond the Euphrates, and the Armenians were left to their own devices.”
12)	AD 63 (Tac. Ann 15.24-31) After Caesennius Paetus’ defeat, for which Corbulo’s inaction may partly have been to blame, the command was returned to Corbulo in AD 63; he was granted extraordinary powers (imperium maius) superior to all the military governors (Legates) and command over the eastern frontier.; Gaius Cestius was appointed to command as Legate of Syria (Tac. 15, 25 .6): “Instructions in writing were given to the tetrarchs (Herodian vassals) and kings, the prefects and procurators, and the praetors in charge of the neighboring provinces, to take their orders from Corbulo, whose powers were raised to nearly the same level as that allowed by the Roman nation to Pompey for the conduct of the Pirate War.” (4c) Nero typically, received the news of Caesennius Paetus’ failure with a joke (Ann. 15,25.7): “When Paetus returned, with apprehensions of a graver cast, the emperor contented himself with a jocular reprimand, the wording of which was roughly, that “he was pardoning him on the spot, lest a person with such a tendency to panic might fall ill if his suspense were protracted.” Corbulo quickly reorganized his legions and invaded Armenia. Now Tiridates and Vologeses were ready to negotiate. Consequently, Corbulo was able to coerce Vologeses into accepting Nero’s demand that Tiridates personally submit to Nero and ask for the throne of Armenia, and he did. Corbulo arranged to meet them at the site of Paetus’ defeat to magnify his own glory and he had the inhumanity to order Paetus’ son to bury the remains of his father's forces. It was agreed that Tiridates would symbolically relinquish his crown in Armenia before an image of Nero and then go to Rome to receive it back ( a bit of theater) by the emperor’s own hands.
13)	AD 63 (Tac. Ann 15.24-31) After Caesennius Paetus’ defeat, for which Corbulo’s inaction may partly have been to blame, the command was returned to Corbulo in AD 63; he was granted extraordinary powers (imperium maius) superior to all the military governors (Legates) and command over the eastern frontier.; Gaius Cestius was appointed to command as Legate of Syria (Tac. 15, 25 .6): “Instructions in writing were given to the tetrarchs (Herodian vassals) and kings, the prefects and procurators, and the praetors in charge of the neighboring provinces, to take their orders from Corbulo, whose powers were raised to nearly the same level as that allowed by the Roman nation to Pompey for the conduct of the Pirate War.” (4c) Nero typically, received the news of Caesennius Paetus’ failure with a joke (Ann. 15,25.7): “When Paetus returned, with apprehensions of a graver cast, the emperor contented himself with a jocular reprimand, the wording of which was roughly, that “he was pardoning him on the spot, lest a person with such a tendency to panic might fall ill if his suspense were protracted.” Corbulo quickly reorganized his legions and invaded Armenia.

It was agreed that Tiridates would symbolically relinquish his crown in Armenia before an image of Nero and then go to Rome to receive it back ( a bit of theater) by the emperor’s own hands.
14)	In AD 66 king Tiridates was formally recognized by Nero in Rome, without Corbulo's having had to assert himself militarily. Armenia would be ruled by the Parthian royal house, and the king would receive his crown from the Roman emperor as a friend of the Roman people.
15)	Nero like Augustus celebrated a diplomatic victory as a military victory: he took his eleventh imperial salutation. He closed the doors of Janus Temple as had Augustus to advertise his achievement of Peace.
16)	In southwest Africa Nero occupied Zanzibar and made plans to conquer Somalia and Ethiopia by expedition down Nile. Nothing came of them.
17)	Black Sea: following Claudius, Nero established a naval patrol on the Black Sea, and routed the Sarmatians out of Crimea. Made plans to conquer Siberia north and east of Caspian Sea. Did nothing.

13f. Foreign policy west boudicca 
1)	Britain: Revolt of Boudicca AD 60-61 Tacitus Annals 14. 29-39; Agricola 14-16;Cassius Dio Epitome 62. 1-12 While Corbulo was campaigning in the east, in Britain a serious revolt erupted following the death of Prasutagus, the chieftain of the Iceni tribe which resided in southeastern Britain near the capitical city of Camulodunum.
2)	In the west, Nero’s most difficult problems occurred in Britain. East Anglia, the area the Romans had annexed under Claudius, was a wealthy area; areas to the north had been left under the control of Prasutagus, the chief of the Iceni tribe, and a friend of Rome. However, the west was more dangerous, and in AD 59 Nero sent Suetonius Paullinus out as governor (Legate) to reduce areas of northern Wales and destroy all centers of Druidism on the island of Mona (Anglesey, off the northwest coast), a dangerous center of Druidism.
3)	Mona was a center of Druidism and a strategic location, as a supply base and a refuge for Rome's enemies in Britain. The Romans regarded Druidism as a dangerous political tool for Celts in Gaul and Britain, who hated Rome.
4)	There were other problems between the Britons and Romans going back to the reign of Claudius: In AD 49 the foundation of a veteran colony at Camulodunum (Colchester), previously the center of the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes, had caused problems because it had involved the confiscation of tribal lands for veterans of Roman commanders. There were also difficulties over the creation, in Camulodunum, of a sanctuary of the imperial cult: Resentful tribes regarded the sanctuary as a “symbol of the alien domination” that had prompted the Roman governor and the procurators to take tribal land and money.
5)	Events leading up to the revolt: In AD 59 Prasutagus the client-king of the Iceni died. He had made informal treaty arrangements with Claudius. His inclusion of the emperor among his heirs in his will was intended to secure decent treatment by the Rome, for his family. However, in AD 60 the financial procurator (agent), Catus Decianus, behaved arrogantly and with greed, and claimed Prasutagus’ kingdom for Nero. The summarizer of Dio Cassius partly blames him for provoking the rebellion. Besides taking Prasutagus’ money, he confiscated money which had been given by Claudius to leading Britons, repudiating the gifts and calling them loans to be repaid with interest.
6)	In short, king Prasutagus, had willed his kingdom to Rome. However, after his death Roman procurators abused his wife Boudicca and her daughters, and on behalf of greedy investors confiscated farmlands and extorted from tribal nobles and farmers. Dio Epitome (62. 2) Seneca (who had investments in Britain) called in loans, and the procurators confiscated imperial gifts that had been designated (by Prasutagus) for prominent provincials. Tac. (14. 31): the beating of Prasutagus’ widow, Boudicca, and the rape of her daughters, was the last straw.
7)	Robbed of her land, and her daughters' virtue. Boudicca raised army of tribes and captured Camulodunum.
8)	Epitome of Cassius Dio 62. 2: Dio’s summarizer blames Decianus and Nero’s advisor, Seneca who had grown wealthy from opportunistic investments, calling in loans and extortion. 1. “An excuse for the war was found in the confiscation of the sums of money that Claudius had given to the foremost Britons; for these sums, as Decianus Catus, the procurator of the island, maintained, were to be paid back. This was one reason for the uprising; another was found in the fact that Seneca, in the hope of receiving a good rate of interest, had lent to the islanders 40,000,000 sesterces that they did not want, and had afterwards called in this loan all at once and had resorted to severe measures in exacting it. 2. But the person who was chiefly instrumental in rousing the natives and persuading them to fight the Romans, the person who was thought worthy to be their leader and who directed the conduct of the entire war, was Boudicca, a Briton woman of the royal family and possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women. 3. This woman assembled her army, to the number of some 120,000, and then ascended a tribunal which had been constructed of earth in the Roman fashion. In stature she was very tall, in appearance most terrifying, in the glance of her eye most fierce, and her voice was harsh. 4. A great mass of the tawniest hair fell to her hips; around her neck was a large golden necklace; and she wore a tunic of diverse colors over which a thick mantle was fastened with a brooch. This was her invariable attire.
9)	Tacitus 14. 31 -38 31.“The Icenian king Prasutagus, celebrated for his long prosperity, had named the emperor his heir, together with his two daughters; an act of deference which he thought would place his kingdom and household beyond the risk of injury. The result was contrary-so much so-that his kingdom was pillaged by centurions, his household by slaves; as though they had been prizes of war. As a beginning, his wife Boudicca was subjected to the lash and his daughters violated. All the chief men of the Icenians were stripped of their family estates, and the relatives of the king were treated as slaves. Impelled by this outrage and the dread of worse to come, for they had now been reduced to the status of a province, they flew to arms, and incited to rebellion the Trinovantes and others, who, not yet broken by servitude, had entered into a secret and treasonable compact to resume their independence. The bitterest animosity was felt against the veterans; who, fresh from their settlement in the colony of Camulodunum, were acting as though they had received a free gift of the entire country, driving the natives from their homes, ejecting them from their lands, they styled them “captives” and “slaves,” and abetted in their fury by the troops, with their similar mode of life and their hopes of equal indulgence. More than this, the temple raised to the deified Claudius continually met the view, like the citadel of an eternal tyranny; while the priests, chosen for its service, were bound under the pretext of religion to pour out their fortunes like water. Nor did there seem any great difficulty in the demolition of a colony unprotected by fortifications-a point too little regarded by our commanders, whose thoughts had run more on the agreeable than on the useful.”
10)	The Iceni and Trinovantes joined Boudicca. The rebellion went unchecked at first because the Legate (military governor) of Britain, Suetonius Paullinus was engaged with most of the province’s four legions in the west (northern Wales and the island of Mona) campaigning against the Druids to destroy their strongholds. Only Petillius Cerialis, Pauillinus’ legionary legate, was in the east near Camulodunum with less than his one legion, the 9th seconded from Spain and quartered near Lincoln (Lindum); however, he arrived with the 9th legion “to the rescue,” as Tacitus writes hopefully. But in fact, as both Tacitus and Dio report, the rebels meted out terrible punishment to several Roman towns: Verulamium (St Albans), Londinium (London) and especially Camulodunum (Colchester), the center of the imperial cult. The Celtic Britons sacked Camulodunum and destroyed the imperial sanctuary. In addition, Boudicca is reported to have destroyed Cerialis’ legion and he fled.
11)	Gaius Suetonius Paullinus Gaius Suetonius Paullinus was a senator, and a praetor in AD 42 (Dio 60. 9). As legionary legate to Claudius, he had established his reputation as a military commander by campaigning against the Mauri tribes in the Atlas mountains (North Africa). It is uncertain whether he accompanied Claudius to Britain in 43. He was consul before 45 (Tac. Hist. 2, 37, 1). In 58 he assumed the governorship as the Legate of Britain. Paullinus conquered Wales and the island of Mona, where he is alleged to have destroyed the Druid cults. As noted, in AD 60 Gaius Suetonius Paullinus as Legate of Britian suppressed the revolt of Boudicca after heavy losses (Tac. Ann. 14, 31-38). Paullinus was relieved of his post partly for dereliction of his duties for being away at the time the revolt erupted (in 60/61 see below); however, he did not fall into Nero’s disfavor, as is demonstrated by the fact that his son received a consulship in AD 66.
12)	Statue of Gaius Suetonius Paullinus in the town of Bath (Somerset England), named for its Roman Baths. The reconstructed baths have nine modern statues dedicated to famous Romans connected to Britain: A personification of Rome, Julius Caesar, five emperors and three governors, including Gaius Suetonius Paullinus, the fifth Roman governor of Britain.
13)	Quintus Petilius Cerialis Quintus Petilius Cerialis Caesius Rufus commanded the Ninth Legion from Spain in Britain as legionary legate of Suetonius Paullinus in AD 60 when the Revolt of Boudicca erupted. His failure to suppress the Revolt of Boudicca (arguably through no fault of his own since Paullinus was away in Mona and Petilius had only his one legion or less at his disposal) appears to have have impeded his military and political promotion. As noted, Boudicca and the Britons routed him and his legion, and he fled the battlefield (Tac. Ann. 14, 32. 3). However, after the civil war following the death of Nero, Petilius became a senior official and commander in the court of (the emperor) Vespasian, who is believed to have been his brother-in-law.
14)	Tacitus 14. 32: When Boudica’s army attacked Camulodunum the inhabitants asked the procurator Decianus for help, but he sent only two hundred men. The city fell, and Decianus fled to Gaul. Cerialis failed to defend Camulodunun, and he fled too. “Women, converted into maniacs by excitement, cried that destruction was at hand and that alien cries had been heard in the senate-house; the theatre had rung with shrieks, and in the estuary of the Thames had been seen a vision of the ruined colony. The ocean had appeared blood-red, and the ebbing tide had left behind it what looked to be human corpses, signs read by the Britons with hope and by the (Roman) veterans with corresponding alarm. However, as Gaius Suetonius Paullinus was far away, they appealed for help to the procurator Catus Decianus. He sent not more than two hundred men, without their proper weapons: in addition, there was a small body of troops in the town. Relying on the protection of the temple and hampered also by covert adherents of the rebellion, who interfered with their plans, they neither secured their position by fosse or rampart nor took steps, by removing the women and the aged, to leave only able-bodied men in the place. They were as carelessly guarded as if the world was at peace, when they were enveloped by a great barbarian host. All else was pillaged or fired in the first onrush: only the temple, in which the troops had massed themselves, stood a two days’ siege, and was then carried by storm. Turning to meet Petilius Cerialis, commander of the ninth legion, who was arriving to the rescue, the victorious Britons routed the legion and slaughtered the infantry to a man: Cerialis with the cavalry escaped to the camp and found shelter behind its fortifications. Unnerved by the disaster and the hatred which his greed had goaded into war, the procurator Catus Decianus crossed to Gaul.”
15)	With Paullinus away, Boudicca is reported to have destroyed the single Roman legion that had been sent out to fight her; she marched on London, and massacred 70,000 Romans. Finally Paullinus abandoned his military operations and returned to neutralize the rebels.Paulinus defeated Boudicca. Boudicca took poison.
16)	Tacitus 14. 33. Massacre of the Romans of Londinium and Verulamium “But Suetonius, with wonderful resolution, marched amidst a hostile population to Londinium, which, though undistinguished by the name of a colony, was much frequented by many merchants and trading vessels. Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he looked round on his small force of soldiers and remembered with what a serious warning the weakness of Petilius had been punished, he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and weeping of the people, as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him. Those who were chained to the spot by the weakness of their sex, or the infirmity of age, or the attractions of the place, were cut off by the enemy. A similar ruin fell on the town of Verulamium, for the barbarians, who delighted in plunder and were indifferent to all else, passed by the fortresses with military garrisons, and attacked whatever offered most wealth to the spoiler, and was unsafe for defense. About seventy thousand citizens and allies, it appeared, fell in the places which I have mentioned. For it was not on making prisoners and selling them, or on any of the barter of war, that the enemy was bent, but on slaughter, on the gallows, the fire and the cross, like men soon about to pay the penalty, and meanwhile snatching at instant vengeance.”
17)	Tac. 14. 34: Paullinus gave battle to jubilant and confident Britons led by Boudicca. “Suetonius had the fourteenth legion with the veterans of the twentieth, and auxiliaries from the neighborhood, to the number of about ten thousand armed men, when he prepared to break off delay and fight a battle. He chose a position approached by a narrow defile, closed in at the rear by a forest, having first ascertained that there was not a soldier of the enemy except in his front, where an open plain extended without any danger from ambuscades. His legions were in close array; round them, the light-armed troops, and the cavalry in dense array on the wings. On the other side, the army of the Britons, with its masses of infantry and cavalry, was confidently exulting, a vaster host than ever had assembled, and so fierce in spirit that they brought with them, to witness the victory, their wives riding in wagons, which they had placed on the extreme border of the plain.” Tacitus 14. 35 Boudicca’s speech “Boudicca, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women. “But now,” she said, “it is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost free-dom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters. Roman lust has gone so far that not our very persons, nor even age or virginity, are left unpolluted. But heaven is on the side of a righteous vengeance; a legion which dared to fight has perished; the rest are hiding themselves in their camp or are thinking anxiously of flight. They will not sustain even the din and the shout of so many thousands, much less our charge and our blows. If you weigh the strength of the armies, and the cause of the war, you will see that in this battle you must conquer or die. This is a woman’s resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves.”
18)	Tacitus 14.36 Suetonius: Paullinus encouraged his men just before the charge: “Nor was Suetonius Paullinus silent at such a crisis. Though he confided in the valor of his men, he mixed encouragements and entreaties to disdain the clamors and empty threats of the barbarians. Such was the enthusiasm which followed the general’s address, and so promptly did the veteran soldiery, with their long experience of battles, prepare for the hurling of the javelins, that it was with confidence in the result that Suetonius gave the signal of battle.” Tacitus 14. 37 Paullinus defeated Boudicca; she took poison. The camp prefect Postumus took his life, ashamed that he had not brought victory to his legion. At first, the legion kept its position, clinging to the narrow defile as a defense; when they had exhausted their missiles, which they discharged with unerring aim on the closely approaching foe, they rushed out in a wedge-like column. Similar was the onset of the auxiliaries, while the cavalry with extended lances broke through all who offered a strong resistance. The rest turned their back in flight, and flight proved difficult, because the surrounding wagons had blocked retreat. Our soldiers spared not to slay even the women, while the very beasts of burden, transfixed by the missiles, swelled the piles of bodies. Great glory, equal to that of old victories, was won on that day. Some indeed say that there fell little less than eighty thousand of the Britons, with a loss to our soldiers of about four hundred, and only as many wounded (surely an exaggeration). Boudicca put an end to her life by poison. Pœnius Postumus too, camp prefect of the second legion, when he knew of the success of the men of the 14th and 20th, feeling that he had cheated his legion out of like glory, and had contrary to all military usage disregarded the general’s orders, threw himself on his sword.”
19)	The revolt damaged relations with Briton tribes and the reputation of Roman governors and procurators. Nero sent Polyclitus, a freedman procurator, to review his policy in Britain. Polyclitus mandated change: any further conquest was put on hold. A new governor (Petronius Tur-pilianus) was sent out to conduct his government more honorably and generously.
20)	Tacitus 14. 38: In the aftermath of the revolt, Nero sent more troops to Britain and took measures to mitigate governance there. Julius Alpinus Classicianus replaced Decianus as financial procurator. “The whole army was then brought together and kept under canvas to finish the remainder of the war. The emperor (Nero) strengthened the forces by sending from Germany 2,000 legionaries, eight cohorts of auxiliaries, and a thousand cavalry. On their arrival the men of the 9th had their number made up with legionary soldiers. The allied infantry and cavalry were placed in new winter quarters, and any tribes which remained hostile were ravaged with fire and sword.” A dispute arose between Paullinus and Classicianus, over Paullinus’ performance in the Boudiccan revolt because at the time it erupted, he was in the west stamping out Druidism, which had allowed Boudicca and her forces to massacre Romans living around Camulodunum. Classicianus also complained to Nero that the punitive policies of Paullinus would lead to more hostilities. “ Nations, too, so high-spirited inclined the more slowly to peace, because Julius Classicianus, who had been sent as successor to Decianus Catus (financial procurator) and was at variance with Suetonius Paullinus, let private animosities interfere with the public interest, and had spread an idea that they ought to wait for a new governor who, having neither the anger of an enemy nor the pride of a conqueror, would deal more mercifully with those who had surrendered.” (Suetonius was notorious for his severity.) At the same time, Classicianus stated in a dispatch to Rome that no cessation of fighting must be expected, unless Suetonius Paullinus were superseded, attributing that general’s disasters to perverseness and his successes to good luck.”
21)	Tacitus 14. 39: Nero also sent the imperial freedman Polyclitus to mediate between Paullinus and Classicianus; and with the newly appointed governor, Petronius Turpilianus, Polyclitus was mandated to implement more moderate and less severe policies in the province, aimed at curbing corruption and extortion by the imperial authorities in Britain. Paullinus was relieved of his command on the pretext of having lost some ships, though his “crime” was his failure to respond immediately when Boudicca revolted. “Accordingly, Polyclitus, one of the freedmen, was sent out to inspect the state of Britain, Nero cherishing high hopes that, through his influence, not only might a reconciliation be brought about between the Legate and the procurator, but the rebellious temper of the natives be brought to acquiesce in peace. Polyclitus, in fact whose immense entourage had committed abuses in Italy and Gaul en route to Britain did not fail, when once he had crossed the seas, to render his march a terror even to Roman soldiers.” (a typical insinuation of the inferior moral tendencies of former slaves and a condemnation of the use by emperors, of former slaves in the imperial service). “To the enemy, on the other hand, Polyclitus was a subject of derision: with them, the fire of freedom was not yet quenched; they had still to make acquaintance with the power of freedmen; and they wondered that a general and an army who had accounted for such a war should obey a troop of slaves. None the less, everything was reported to the emperor in a more favorable light. Suetonius was retained at the head of affairs; but, when later on he lost a few ships on the beach, and the crews with them, he was ordered, under pretense that the war was still in being, to transfer his army to Petronius Turpilianus, who by now had laid down his consulate. The newcomer abstained from provoking the enemy, was not challenged himself, and conferred on this spiritless inaction the honorable name of peace.”
22)	Petronius Turpilianus served as consul in AD 61 but resigned from his magistracy after having been appointed by Nero to serve as Legate of Roman Britain until 63. Turpilianus replaced Suetonius Paullinus, who was stripped of his office, following the rebellion of Boudicca. In contrast to Paullinus’ paramilitary, harsh governance, Petronius Turpilianus was less intrusive and less punitive.
23)	As we will see, Petronius Turpilianus revealed the Pisonian Conspiracy against Nero in AD 65 (13 g), for which he was given triumphal honors. In 68, Nero mandated him to lead forces against the rebellious Gauls under Vindex, who tried to dethrone Nero. After Nero’s fall, Turpilianus was put to death by Galba without a trial (14 a).

13g. Conspiracies: Pisonian and Vinician
1)	The sources report that the growing hatred of the senate was aggravated by Nero’s policy of putting more freedmen of Greek and eastern backgrounds in senior posts of the civil service. In addition, the armies hated Nero because he was unable to pay them, as a result of the spending he undertook after the Great Fire. As hatred and fear of Nero grew, conspiracies were organized.
2)	1. AD 65 Conspiracy of Piso (Pisonian Conspiracy) Tacitus Annals 15. 48-74
a)	After 65 Nero used spies and agents in his praetorian guard. His spies, including the consular and former governor (Legate) of Britain, Petronius Turpilianus, uncovered a conspiracy that had been orchestrated by Gaius Calpurnius Piso; it included Stoics, senators, equestrians and republicans, all of whom objected to Nero’s tyrannical reign and in the monarchy in general. In fact, the list of conspirators resembles closely that of the assassins of Caligula, except that no imperial freedmen are named. Turpilianus, who replaced Paullinus as Legate of Britain (see 13e) was rewarded by Nero with triumphal honors, for stopping the conspiracy. The conspirator Gaius Calpunius Piso was a descendant of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria who had been convicted of treason by Tiberius after the death of Germanicus (10b, 17); Gaius Calpurnius Piso had also been forced to divorce his wife so that Caligula could marry her (11e 6-8).
b)	Piso Background Tac. Ann. 15. 48; 15. 59. Nero’s replacement was to be Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a descendant of the republican nobility who was widely popular. He himself had been in exile when Caligula was killed. Piso inherited from his father (whom we can’t identify) connections with many distinguished families, and from his mother great wealth, which he lavished on beneficiaries of all classes. Tacitus writes that he was handsome, genial, and an eloquent lawyer in the courts; he might pass for a man of high character but was not. Like Memmius Regulus, another new rival of Nero,* he had lost his wife, Livia Orestilla (11e, 7) to Caligula, but subsequently stole for himself another man’s wife, Satria Galla, who was beautiful but low-born. Exiled by Caligula, restored by Claudius, he had been consul, but he had not governed a province. An orator, he also sang on the tragic stage, he wrote poetry, and he owned a villa at Baiae. Piso now wanted to be emperor. He was unnerved by the revelations in the exchange of treason charges between Seneca, Nero’s confidante and Romanus an imperial freedman (both “insiders” in Nero’s court); on the other hand, Nero evidently ignored these disclosures and complacently allowed Piso to bide his time. *Regulus had been coerced into forfeiting his wife, Lollia Paullina, to Caligula (11e, 11)
3)	The Plan Nero was to be attacked while attending the chariot races at the Circus Maximus, just as Caligula had been killed on his way from theatrical performances at the Palatine games. The tactical advantages were similar: access to the emperor was easy, and Nero's movements would be restricted by the crowds. The plan was modelled closely on the murder of Julius Caesar: the senator, Plautius Lateranus, a republican idealist, was to present a petition to Nero and then grab his knees, to prevent him from avoiding the daggers of the surrounding conspirators. The conspirators had learned a lesson about securing the allegiance of the entire Praetorian Guard from the outcome of the final plot against Caligula: they did not want any lurking, inappropriate successors like Claudius to be found by the praetorians behind a curtain and rushed off to the Praetorian camp to be crowned (!). Piso himself immediately after the murder in the Circus, was to be escorted from the temple of Ceres near the praetorian camp by the praetorian prefect, Faenius Rufus and other officers. There had been some delay and hesitation, but Tacitus reports that the whole conspiracy was conceived and executed in AD 65, though he mentions a report that the praetorian tribune Subrius Flavus had been tempted to kill Nero earlier during a stage performance, or in the confusion of the Great Fire a year earlier in AD 64 (Ann. 15. 48, 50, 33).
4)	Why did the conspirators wait until AD 65? Tacitus names the praetorians among the initiators of the plot, but it is worth noting that they waited a long time to murder Nero after he had murdered his mother (Ann. 14. 7, 4). As personal bodyguards, praetorians hated family murders. The delay reveals the power of the praetorian prefects during these years, who had been able to control the resentment harbored by the praetorians until 62. However, after the death of Nero’ mother, Agrippina the Younger, Rufus Faenius who had been one of her favorites, lost influence with Nero and Tigellinus, the other Prefect insinuated himself in Nero’s court. Another factor may have been the fact that Nero’s wife Sabina Poppaea was pregnant again. The possible birth of an heir, would have given Nero more license to do as he pleased, and it would also cause complications for any later assassination: “not even the most vehement enemies of Caligula were happy to see his infant daughter murdered in 41” Griffin (Josephus Ant. Jud. I9. 200; Suet. Gaius 59; Dio 59· 29, 7). But if Poppaea produced an heir, and they were to be spared, it would be better to have Nero’s successor safely installed before their birth.
5)	Epicharis According to the sources, a commander of the fleet at Misenum, named Volusius Proculus reported the conspiracy in its early stages to the imperial court. The story involves a freedwoman named Epicharis, who was allegedly the mistress of Seneca’s brother. According to Polyaenus (Strategems 8. 62) she was a leading member of the conspiracy and may have become involved through the brother, Mela; Tacitus reports (15.51, 52, 57) that no one knew how she knew about it, although he indirectly implicates Volusius Proculus, whom Epicharis tried to draw in as well, to rally the conspirators into action and carry their plan into effect with more haste. In any case, Proculus betrayed the vague outlines of the plot to Nero, naively thinking it would bring him favor and promotion by the court. Of course, it did not, and the emperor had him put to death. Epicharis was summoned before Nero, but since no names had been mentioned, and no witnesses had been present at the interrogation, she refuted the accusation. But she was taken into custody, and subsequently, when the conspiracy was uncovered by Petronius Turpilianus, Nero ordered her to be tortured because she refused to name the accomplices, and her torturers were unable to extort a confession from her. When on the second or third day after she was carried, in a litter, (for her limbs were by now broken), to be tortured a second time, she strangled herself on her way with her belt, which she had fastened to the seat. Tacitus reports that she acted more courageously than many a noble equestrian or senatorial men, who without being tortured would betray their nearest relatives.
6)	Tacitus 15. 53-59: the revelation of the plot and aftermath: On the morning it was to be carried out, 19 April, the conspirators’ plot was revealed; and this time the names of the conspirators were given to Nero’s agents. A freedman named Milichus had informed on his former master, Flavius Scaevinus a conspirator, after receiving orders to sharpen a knife and prepare bandages. According to Tacitus, Milichus exposed Scaevinus out of greed, at the urging of his wife, and reported the details to Nero’s (freedman) secretary, Epaphroditus. Scaevinus avoided suspicion, at first discrediting the evidence as circumstantial; however, he was seized and threatened with torture; in addition, Milichus' wife gave more evidence and reported that Scaevinus and Antonius Natalis, another conspirator, had been meeting in secret for a while. When Scaevinus was handed over to the praetorian prefect, Faenius Rufus, who was also a conspirator, he incriminated him as well; during the trial which followed in the court, another conspirator, Subrius Flavus, declared his hatred of Nero and revealed more details. Nero moved quickly to execute the conspirators: Gaius Calpurnius Piso was among the first to be convicted and ordered to commit suicide. He fled Rome for his villa (in Baiae) and waited for Nero’s praetorians to come for him. After Nero ordered him to commit suicide, Piso severed the arteries of each arm and bled to death.
7)	Tacitus 16, 60: “The next killing, that of the consul designate Plautius Lateranus, was added by Nero to the list with such speed that he allowed him neither to embrace his children nor the usual moment’s respite in which to choose his death. Dragged to the place reserved for the execution of slaves, (known as the Sessorium, in the Campus Esquilinus). He was slaughtered by the hand of the tribune Statius, resolutely silent and disdaining to reproach the tribune with his complicity in the same affair.”
8)	The Pisonian Conspiracy and the persecution of Stoics Nero’s punishment of Stoics for political crimes and conspiracies has suggested to some scholars that there was a bona fide philosophical Stoic opposition to Nero, and that the emperor responded by persecuting Stoics as a matter of policy simply for adhering to Stoicism. However, those Stoics who were persecuted and punished, or forced to take their lives in the aftermath of the conspiracy, all had political connections to Nero, or were related by birth to men who were opposed to or conspired against Nero for political reasons. I.e., these men were not punished simply because they were Stoics, but also because they had other strikes against them. E.g., when the Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus was banished as an accomplice in the conspiracy, Tacitus states that the real reason for his conviction was not his Stoicism per se, but his fame as a philosopher (Ann. 14. 57, 3; 15.71, 4); Lucan, Seneca’s nephew, an organizer of the conspiracy and a friend of Piso, was sentenced to death on charges of complicity (Tac. Ann 15, 70; 16, 17). Two senators and Stoics, Thrasea Paetus and Curtius Montanus were condemned for political disaffection (Tac. Ann. 15. 49; 60; 71; 16. 18; 21; 28); Rubellius Plautus, who was charged with “Stoic arrogance,” among other things as noted (13b, 22-24) and decapitated in front of his wife, was a threat to Nero because of his JulioClaudian bloodlines (Tac. Hist. 4. 10, 1; 40. 3; Ann. 14. 59; Epictetus 1. 1, 27).
9)	Seneca and Nero (see also 11a, 18-19). Upon Nero’s elevation to the throne, Seneca became known as amicus Principis, friend of the emperor through his influence and role as an advisor and a member of his consilium; as Nero’s former tutor, Seneca maintained his influence as mentor, adviser, and confidant throughout his reign. Seneca’s detractors teased Nero for remaining under Seneca’s influence; in his account of Seneca’s suicide on Nero’s orders, following the Pisonian conspiracy, Tacitus underlines the wickedness of Nero’s condemnation of Seneca by speaking of the murder of “his teacher and mentor” (Tac. Ann. 13. 6, 2; 14. 52, 4; 15. 62, 2). What did Seneca do to deserve his death sentence? Seneca followed his Stoic principles scrupulously, which led to his withdrawal gradually over time from public life, the senate and Nero’s court, alleging ill health and old age. However, his retirement on these personal grounds did not sit well with Nero, who believed Seneca’s behavior was a silent condemnation of himself; Nero was also aware of how much Seneca knew, and he would have liked to keep him on a tight rein in the last years of his reign.
10)	After Plautius Lateranus, Seneca was the next to die, even though Tacitus insinuates his part in the plot was never established. But implicated, Seneca was ordered by Nero to kill himself. He and his wife Pompeia, severed their veins. Tac. Ann.15. 60–4; Dio 62. 24–5.
11)	Tacitus reports Nero (cruelly) ordered Seneca’s wife to be saved. Her wounds were bound up and she survived. Seneca’s age and diet resulted in the slow loss of blood, which produced extended pain, rather than a quick death, and the poison he took was also not fatal.
12)	After dictating his last words to a scribe, and surrounded by friends, he took a hot bath to speed the blood flow and to ease the pain, and he was suffocated by the steam from the bath.
13)	After dictating his last words to a scribe, and surrounded by friends, he took a hot bath to speed the blood flow and to ease the pain, and he was suffocated by the steam from the bath.
14)	Annaeus Lucan; Lucan, Seneca’s nephew, a philosopher and a conspirator, was also killed. “Nero next ordained the death of Lucan. When his blood was flowing, and he felt his feet and hands chilling and the life receding little by little from the extremities, though the heart retained warmth and sentience, Lucan recalled a passage in his own poem, where he had described a wounded soldier dying a similar form of death, and he recited the verses.Those were his last words.”
15)	Gaius Petronius; Another famous victim of Nero, was the novelist and satirist, Gaius Petronius (Satyricon) who was known as the “arbiter of elegance” (Tac. Ann 16. 18-19). He was implicated in the conspiracy of Piso, allegedly for having attracted the jealousy of the praetorian prefect, Tigellinus, and so was accused of treason. Arrested at Cumae in 65, he did not wait for a sentence, but took his own life.
16)	Tacitus Annals 16. 18-19: Tigellinus arrests Petronius on suspicion of complicity in the Pisonisn Conspiracy 18. “Petronius calls for a brief retrospect. He was a man whose day was passed in sleep, his nights in the social duties and amenities of life: others industry may raise to greatness; Petronius had idled into fame. Nor was he regarded, like the common crowd of spendthrifts, as a debauchee and wastrel, but as the finished artist of extravagance. His words and actions had a freedom and a stamp of self-abandonment which rendered them doubly acceptable by an air of native simplicity. Yet as proconsul of Bithynia, and later as (suffet) consul, he showed himself a man of energy and competent to affairs. Then, lapsing into the habit, or copying the features, of vice, he was adopted into the narrow circle of Nero's intimates as his Arbiter of Elegance; the jaded emperor finding charm and delicacy in nothing save what Petronius had commended. His success awoke the jealousy of Tigellinus * against an apparent rival, more expert in the science of pleasure than himself. He addressed himself, thus, to the emperor’s cruelty, to which all other passions gave pride of place; arraigning Petronius for friendship with Scaevinus,** while suborning one of his slaves to turn (against him as an) informer, withholding all opportunity of defense, and placing the greater part of his household under arrest.”
17)	“In those days, as it chanced, the emperor had migrated to Campania; and Gaius Petronius, after going as far as Cumae, was there detained in custody. He declined to tolerate further the delays of fear or hope; yet still did not hurry to take his life but caused his already severed arteries to be bound up to meet his whim, then opened them once more, and began to converse with his friends, in no grave strain and with no view to the fame of a stout-hearted ending. He listened to them as they rehearsed, not discourses upon the immortality of the soul or the doctrines of philosophy, but light songs and frivolous verses. Some of his slaves tasted of his bounty, including his wine. He took his place at dinner, and drowsed a little, so that death, if compulsory, should at least resemble nature. Not even in his will did he follow the routine of suicide by flattering Nero or Tigellinus or another of the mighty, but, prefixing the names of the various catamites and women, detailed the imperial debauches and the novel features of each act of lust and sent the document under seal to Nero. He broke his signet ring, lest it should render dangerous service later.”
18)	Nero was surely shaken when the Pisonian conspiracy (Tac. 15. 57.4) was uncovered by Turpilianus because he had been completely ignorant about it, and also because the plot almost succeeded. This close call changed his attitude toward his rivals, and he became more vindictive and paranoid for the rest of his reign. After the conspiracy was revealed, a judicial proceeding followed it up. The case was tried in Nero’s court; there were arrests, interrogations, evidence, tortures (the law also admitted the testimony of slaves), state’s witnesses and confessions. After the conclusion of the trial, there was a full publication of the proceedings by Nero, an address to the Senate and an edict to the people, including the testimony and the confessions (Tac. 15. 73 .1). Tacitus states in his summary (15. 73. 3) that those, who at the time had any care for the truth did not doubt that a conspiracy had been proved, and that persons who were exiled on conviction, when they were restored after Nero’s death, admitted their guilt. This is interesting and odd, because one would have expected tyrannous lawlessness in the aftermath of a revelation of a Neronian conspiracy; yet in this case there was a legal procedure. That said, in his narratives of other cases Tacitus denies directly that there were other trials or does not mention them.
19)	2. AD 66 Conspiracy of Vinicianus (Vinician Conspiracy) In AD 66 another conspiracy was uncovered at Beneventum. It was led by Annius Vinicianus and Annius Pollio, the sons of Lucius Annius Vinicianus. Lucius Annius Vinicianus was a ringleader of the final plot to dethrone Caligula (11f,5); following this, Vinicianus instigated the conspiracy and armed revolt of Camillus Scribonianus, the Legate of Dalmatia, against Claudius (12b, 22-27; Jos. Ant. Jud. 19. 49; 52; Cassius Dio 60. 15, 1; Pliny Ep. 3· 16, 7). The Viniciani brothers were planning to put the father-in-law of Annius Vinicianus, Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo on the throne, although Corbulo does not seem to have been aware of the plot. As the son of Gn. Domitius Corbulo (quaestor in Asia under Augustus) and Vistilia (Plin. HN 7, 39), Corbulo was the half-brother of Milonia Caesonia, Caligula's wife, and it is probably through her intervention that Corbulo received a suffet consulship in AD 39 (13e, 8). Claudius promoted Corbulo as legate on the Rhine and made him Proconsul of Asia; he was commissioned by Nero to campaign on the eastern frontier. As we have seen, in 63, Corbulo persuaded the Parthian king, Tiridates to submit to Nero and accept the the vassal kingship of Armenia; in 66, the same year as the conspiracy, Tiridates personally received the crown from the emperor Nero in Rome (13e, 7-18). Corbulo might have known he would soon be executed by Nero’s praetorians. His own father-in-law, Cassius Longinus was condemned in 65, and the son of his halfbrother had been exiled with Annius Pollio (Vinicianus’ brother) all after the Pisonian conspiracy (Tac. Ann. 15. 28, 3; Dio 62. 23, 6). Tacitus mentions another son of Corbulo’s half -brother who died in a conspiracy, in Book 16 of the Annals (Ann 16, 2). Book 16, what there is of it, is the last preserved book of the Annals; it covers AD 66, so we can make the inference that the boy probably died in the Vinician conspiracy. Otherwise, the conspiracy of Vinicianus is mentioned only by Suetonius, who calls it the coniuratio Viniciana and says it was conceived and detected at Beneventum and led by Annius Vinicianus, the son-in-law of Corbulo; Suetonius gives no indication of the date, except that the Vinician Conspiracy came after the Pisonian conspiracy (Suet. Nero 36). In addition, we have it on record that the Arval Brothers offered thanks “for the detection of a wicked plot” at a date after mid-May and before taking the vows for Nero’s safe return on 25 September 66 when he departed for Greece. The location at Beneventum suggests that the plot originally involved attacking Nero on his way to Greece, for he would naturally have stopped in Beneventum en route.
20)	Suetonius 36, 3 “Those outside his family he (Nero) assailed with no less cruelty. It chanced that a comet had begun to appear on several successive nights, a thing which is commonly believed to portend the death of great rulers. Worried by this and learning from the astrologer Balbillus that kings usually averted such omens by the death of some distinguished man, thus turning them from themselves upon the heads of the nobles, he resolved on the death of all the eminent men of the State; but the more firmly, and with some semblance of justice, after the discovery of two conspiracies. The earlier and more dangerous of these was that of Piso at Rome; the other was set on foot by Vinicianus at Beneventum and detected there. The conspirators made their defense in triple sets of fetters, some voluntarily admitting their guilt, some even making a favor of it, saying that there was no way except by death that they could help a man disgraced by every kind of wickedness. The children of those who were condemned were banished or put to death by poison or starvation; a number are known to have been slain all together at a single meal along with their preceptors*and attendants, while others were prevented from earning their daily bread.”
21)	As a sign of the imperial confidence, according to Dio, Nero had given Annius Vinicianus command of one of Corbulo’s legions in AD 63, and he served with Corbulo in Armenia. By the time Corbulo was mandated to escort Tiridates to Rome (66), he felt it was necessary to reassure Nero of his loyalty, and so he sent his son-in-law, Annius Vinicianus back to Rome, as collateral. When Vinicianus arrived in Rome (May of AD 66), the trials of those who had been involved in the Pisonian conspiracy (of whom one was Vinicianus’ wife’s brother) were in progress. Vinicianus’ own brother, Annius Pollio had also been exiled for his association with Piso ( he may or may not have been involved Tac. 15.71.6). In any case, these events are believed to have led Vinicianus to conspire against Nero.. When the plot was found out, (in 66) Nero was still in Rome and now regarded the entire senatorial order as his enemy. According to Suetonius (Nero 37), he began to talk about exterminating the order and handing the provinces and armies over to the equestrians and imperial freedmen. Aquilius Regulus, an active delator (accuser and informer) in 66, was said to have called Nero lazy because he was destroying the senators one by one, when they could all be wiped out with a single command (Tac. Hist. 4, 42. Aquillius’ victims, Dio 63. 18, 2; Pliny Ep. 5, 3).
22)	Suetonius 37 1. After this he (Nero) showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death whom he pleased on any pretext whatever. 2. To those who were bidden to die he never granted more than an hour's respite, and to avoid any delay, he brought physicians who were at once to "attend to" such as lingered; for that was the term he used for killing them by opening their veins. It is even believed that it was his wish to throw living men to be torn to pieces and devoured by a monster of Egyptian birth, who would crunch raw flesh and anything else that was given him. 3. Transported and puffed up by such successes, as he considered them, he boasted that no prince had ever known what power he really had, and he often threw out unmistakable hints that he would not spare even those of the senate who survived but would one day blot out the whole order from the State and hand over the rule of the provinces and the command of the armies to the Roman knights and to his freedmen. Certain it is that neither on beginning a journey nor on returning did he kiss any member or even return his greeting; and at the formal opening of the work at the Isthmus (of Corinth) the prayer which he uttered in a loud voice before a great throng was, that the event might result favorably "for himself and the people of Rome," thus suppressing any mention of the senate.
23)	One might have thought that after the revelation of what was a hostile and widespread senatorial conspiracy, Nero would have cancelled his planned trip to Greece. But after the public coronation of Tiridates, he felt confident that he was supported by the plebs. Evidently, he did not see any threat posed by the praetorians and the equestrians in Rome, except of his own assassination, which his absence would prevent. For Nero planned to deal with any senatorial military governors he distrusted while he was in Greece. In fact, he was probably eager to escape from Rome. It had been more than twenty years since an emperor had ventured out of Italy, the last occasion being Claudius’ participation in the conquest of Britain in AD 43/44. Nero was looking forward to competing in the oecumenical (international) Greek games which included musical and artistic competitions. Nero was also popular in Greece. Nero’s trip to promote his theatrical talents would probably have alienated the old aristocracy, and his complicated itinerary would have kept him out of Rome for a long time; in addition, he had recklessly left his freedman Helius in charge of Rome, with the authority to confiscate, banish and execute men of all ranks (Dio 60. 21, 2). Following custom, one of the Praetorian prefects, Tigellinus escorted him to Greece; the other Praetorian prefect Nymphidius Sabinus stayed in Rome and ultimately usurped power, taking control of the Praetorian guard at the time of Nero’s deposal.
24)	Besides Nero’s “sinister wardrobe mistress” Calvia Crispinilla (who would incite a rebellion against him in Africa 13h) and his new wife Statilia Messalina, most of the imperial entourage whose names are preserved were freedmen. This was normal, for wherever an emperor was, embassies had to be processed, letters had to be received, and replies had to be written (Dio 63. 12, 3-4; Tac. Hist. 1. 73). In AD 67, while in Greece, Nero summoned those suspected in the conspiracy under false pretenses: Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo was summoned, as were other military governors posted in Gaul, the Balkans and on the Danube. Corbulo was denounced by a subordinate, on what charges we do not know (Tac. Hist. 3.6.1). Nero ordered his execution which he anticipated by committing suicide. Also summoned to Greece were Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Proculus, and his brother, Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Rufus, the legionary legates of Lower and Upper Germany respectively, from AD 59-67. The brothers Sulpicii Scribonii were active rivals of Nero and were denounced by an informer (delator) named Gaius Paccius Africanus. Under threat of prosecution for treason and failing to obtain trials, they committed suicide (Dio 63.17). Nero appointed new (legionary) legates to replace them. As for Annius Vinicianus and Annius Pollio, who were in Rome, we assume that at this time they were also executed or took their lives, but we have no account of their deaths and exactly when and where they occurred (AD 66 or 67).
25)	Dio 63. 17 on the deaths ordered by Nero in Greece 1. “For this and other purposes he (Nero) needed great sums of money; and as he was at once a promoter of great enterprises and a giver of great gifts, and at the same time feared an attack from the persons of most influence while he was thus engaged, he made away with many excellent men. 2. Of most of these I shall omit any account, inasmuch as the stock complaint under which all of them were brought before him was excellence, wealth, or family; and all of them either killed themselves or were slain by others. I shall, however, mention Corbulo and the two Sulpicii Scribonii, Rufus and Proculus. 3. The latter two were brothers of about the same age and had never done anything separately but had remained united in purpose and in property as they were in family; they had for a long time administered the two Germanies together, and now came to Greece at the summons of Nero, who pretended to want them for something.” 4. “Complaints of the kind in which that period abounded were lodged against them, but they could neither obtain a hearing nor get within sight of Nero; and as this caused them to be slighted by everybody alike, they began to long for death and so met their end by opening their veins. 5. I mention Corbulo because the emperor, after sending him also a most courteous summons and invariably calling him, among other names, ‘father’ and ‘benefactor,’ then, when this general landed at Cenchreae, commanded that he should be slain before he had even entered his presence. Some explain this by saying that Nero was to appear as a lyre-player and could not endure the idea of being seen by Corbulo while he wore the long, ungirded tunic. 6. The condemned man, as soon as he understood the order, seized a sword, and dealing himself a lusty blow exclaimed: “Your due!” Then, indeed, for the first time he was convinced that he had done wrong both in sparing the lyre-player and in going to him unarmed. 18. This was what was going on in Greece. Is it worth while to add that Nero ordered Paris, the pantomimic dancer, to be slain because the emperor had wished to learn dancing from him but had not the capacity? Or that he banished Caecina Tuscus, the governor of Egypt, for bathing in the bath that had been specially constructed for the emperor’s intended visit to Alexandria?”

13h. Revolt of vindex and death 
1)	In the end, Nero was recalled by his freedman (!) Helius, who went to Greece himself when Nero refused to heed his warnings. According to Dio, Helius informed Nero that another conspiracy was developing in Rome (Dio 61.12, 3). This may have been intended to persuade Nero to return to Rome, for Nero thought that he could prevent revolts in Rome simply by summoning more suspected legionary legates and military governors to Greece and executing them (Dio 63. 19, 11; Suet. Nero 23.1). Nothing more is heard of the Vinician conspiracy after Helius’ trip. Helius was worried about the early moves of Julius Vindex, Legate of Gallia Lugdunensis, and his letters to other provincial Legates to convince them to rebel against Nero (Plut. Galba 42; Suet. Galba 9. 2). What prompted Helius to go out to Greece to retrieve Nero, were these first rumors of a military revolt in Gaul.
2)	Julius Vindex, the Legate (military governor) of Gallia Lugdunensis, approached several provincial governors proposing a revolt; some sent letters to Nero, warning him of this. Sulpicius Galba, Legate (military governor) of Tarraconensis, ignored them, and Nero must have received some hint of this, for Galba had allegedly intercepted orders for his own death, which had been sent by Nero to his procurator in Spain before Vindex led an armed revolt in Gaul in March of AD 68
3)	The revolt in Gaul, early in AD 68, led by Julius Vindex, a (Romanized) Gallic noble and the Legate (military governor) of Gallia Lugdunensis, was the beginning of the end for Nero. (Plut. Galb. 4.2; Tac. Hist. 1.16, 2). Gallia Lugdunensis was an unarmed province, however its Legate had seniority over the legionary legates of the other Gallic provinces, all of which were armed except for Narbonensis; thus, its governor and subordinate Gallic provinces were armed (and imperial and garrisoned). Vindex’ motivation was not anti-Roman Celtic nationalism, but rather the desire to depose Nero. The uprising was provoked by the excessive taxation of Roman provincials in Gaul by imperial procurators, brought on by the lack of funds in Rome, (again) due to Nero’s excessive spending after the Great Fire. In addition, Nero’s neglect of the legions and failure to pay their proper wages contributed to the revolt. These crises after the military purges conducted by Nero in Greece, signalled a rebellion and the end of Nero’s reign.
4)	Vindex was against Nero and against tyranny in principle. His coinage promotes him as a protector of the liberty of the Roman people, and as the leader of a revolt against the tyranny of Nero. The iconography and legends of his coins invoke Augustan propaganda: on the obverse, is a depiction of Divine Augustus; on the reverse, “In service of the state.”
5)	When news of the revolt came, Nero was not concerned, and did not even inform the Senate for a week (Suet. Nero 40. 4); this was in March, when Nero was in Naples celebrating the anniversary of his mother’s death. He did not regard Vindex as a threat, because he had only a few legions, and there was a praetorian cohort at Lugdunum, loyal to the imperial court. In addition, rebellions in Gaul were the responsibility of the legionary legate of Upper Germany, and Nero had appointed Verginius Rufus, a loyal supporter. Rufus replaced the former legate of Upper Germany, Sulpicius Scribonius Publius Rufus, whom Nero had forced to take his life in Greece in AD 67 along with his brother. After a week Nero wrote to the Senate for support; returned to Rome (from Greece) and summoned a meeting of his consilium (Suet. Nero 41; Dio 63. 26). But after three weeks, there was alarming news that Sulpicius Galba was negotiating with Vindex and had declared himself Legate of the Senate and Roman People. Galba had only one legion, but Spain had a large citizen population, from which he began to recruit a second legion. He was supported by his own legionary legate Titus Vinius, by M. Otho, the Legate (military governor) of Lusitania, and by the (military) quaestor of Baetica: as a senatorial province its governor had no military mandate (Suet. Galba 10. 2; 14. 2; Plut. Galba 5; Dio 63. 23; 64. 6, 52; Tac. Hist. I. 13, 4; 1. 53).
6)	Nero was shaken by the news and now seems to have taken some action. He deposed one of the consuls and assumed the office of consul himself to signify his real leadership of the state and his decision to take the field. He declared Galba a public enemy and confiscated his property. He summoned back to Rome, legionary units from Illyricum, Germany and Britain, who had been already on their way east for various campaigns; finally, he recruited a legion, the First Adiutrix, from the fleet at Misenum and other troops in Rome. These forces were then stationed in northern Italy under the command of Petronius Turpilianus, Nero’s trusty former Legate of Britain who had brought peace to that province after the revolt of Boudicca and had recently uncovered the Pisonian conspiracy. However, Nero did not himself leave Rome to lead his armies. The sequence of events from mid-April, when these preparations must have been made, up to the day of Nero’s death on 9 June is difficult to reconstruct. (Suet. Nero 43; 44. 1; Pliny Pan. 57. 2; Plut. Galba 54; Tac. Hist. 1. 6; 9; 31;70; Dio 63. 27).

After he learned of Galba’s defection, Nero was informed of the revolt of Clodius Macer, the legate of the 3rd legion in Africa, who proclaimed himself champion of liberty and raised his own freedom legion of auxiliary troops, the Legio Macriana Liberatrix (Macer’s Liberators). Nero sent his friend and “wardrobe designer” Calvia Crispinilla to Africa to deal with Macer. Oddly, she had been considered important enough to be trusted with this mission. Because (according to Tacitus), she treacherously tried to goad Clodius Macer into withholding the grain shipments from Africa to Rome, which would have been a political problem for Nero. (Plut. Galba 6; Tac. Hist. 1. 73). Dio’s story of her greed in Greece (63. 11. 2), is probably exaggerated, but the story of her deployment to Africa, reveals that Nero trusted her and followed her advice.
8)	Tacitus reports that Crispinella intrigued with Macer, and the people of Rome held her responsible for the attempted revolt. Macer continued to revolt for a month after Nero’s death, until Galba had him executed after he assumed power. Tacitus Histories I 73 “At the same time the people demanded the punishment of Calvia Crispinilla. But she was saved from danger through various artifices on the part of the emperor, who brought ill-reputation upon himself by his duplicity. Crispinilla had taught Nero reckless behavior; then she crossed to Africa to stir up Clodius Macer to revolt and openly tried to bring famine on the Roman people. Afterwards she secured popularity with the entire city by her marriage with a former consul, and so was unharmed under Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. Later she became powerful through her wealth and childlessness, which have equal weight both in good and evil times.” Obverse: L CLODIVS MACER, SC below, Head of Clodius Macer.

9)	The revolt in Gaul was supported by other military governors, as well as legionary legates in other provinces; Sulpicius Galba, the Legate of Tarraconensis who supported the revolt, was the contender for the throne, and was supported by the senate. Nero’s man Petronius Turpilianus, was to campaign against the other Gaulish tribes which rebelled; but the revolt itself was suppressed by Verginius Rufus, the legionary legate of Upper Germany, who, like Turpilianus, was loyal to Nero. In May of AD 68 the legions of Upper Germany under the command of Verginius Rufus, and reinforced by detachments from the legions of Lower Germany, advanced west into Gallia Belgica, and gave battle at Vesontio, defeating Vindex (the Legate of Gallia Lugdunensis). Vindex committed suicide; Rufus’ legions were so elated at their victory that they tried to elevate Rufus to the throne, but he rejected the bid since it was not condoned by the senate or the people, and he kept his word (Dio. 63 24-25; Plut. Galba 6; Tac. Hist. 1. 8). *Located in eastern France on the border of Switzerland, Vesontio is the ancient Latin name for Besançon in the Jura Mountains on the River Doubs.
10)	Dio’s view (63. 25, 1 2) that the German troops delayed abandoning Nero and that Rufus delayed proclaiming Galba as emperor is supported by Tacitus (Hist. 1. 8; 4. 69): Rufus may even have delayed putting down the rebellion of Vindex as long as he could, without compromising his mandate (Plut. Galba 6. 2, 3; 10. 2; Dio 63. 25; Pliny Ep. 9. 19, 5). Dio and Plutarch’s claim that Verginius Rufus lost control of his troops, and consequently they attacked Vindex on their own initiative, is unlikely since the detail that his happy troops offered Rufus the purple (to elevate him to the throne) would not make sense: For they would not have offered a man who had failed to maintain control of his own troops, control of the empire. In addition, they would have been executed or punished by Galba, who was waiting on the sidelines ready to assume power as emperor: he would have regarded them as a threat because they did not proclaim him immediately. Galba, who removed Verginius Rufus, afterward, under the pretext of friendship, may have promoted the story that Rufus lost control of his troops and allowed them to initiate the defeat of Vindex, because Rufus was now arguably a rival; but Rufus was spared by the new emperor (Galba), and he retired until, brought out of retirement in the reign of Domitian, he died in 97, after a fall in which he broke his hip.
11)	Thus, ironically, the end for Nero and his reign came in the victory of one of his own appointees, Rufus, over a usurper. After Rufus recognized Galba, Nero sent out a second commander (legate), Rubrius Gallus, to north Italy, and once again he (Nero) did not command his forces himself. However, Gallus’ legion (the 14th) was prevented from taking action by its Batavian auxiliaries, who were sympathetic to the Batavian supporters of Vindex, and later claimed to have taken Italy from Nero. In addition, Nero’s legate Petronius Turpilianus wavered: he declared for Galba, but after Galba took power, he (Galba) put him to death as a Neronian general, without a trial; it may be that Turpilianus delayed, just as Rufus had done, in dealing with Vindex, hoping for word from Rome that Nero was deposed. At some point, too, some Illyrican troops in Italy hailed Verginius Rufus as Emperor, though this may only have happened after Nero’s death. In any case, the news about Rufus and Turpilianus convinced Nero that the rest of his army had defected. And believing that all was lost, Nero began to lay plans for fleeing Rome. He decided to go to Alexandria, unaware that the loyalty of the Prefect of Egypt was going over to Galba, as well. (Suet. Nero 47· 1-2; Plut. Galba 2. 1; 15. 2; 17. 3 Dio 63. 27; Tac Hist. 1. 6.9 ;2.27)
12)	Obv: SER GALBA IMP AVGVSTVS, Rev: LIBERTAS PUBLlCA, SC Libertas, draped, and holding pileus. The end of Nero’s reign was inevitable: in June of 68 Servius Sulpicius Galba, the Legate of Tarraconensis sent agents to Rome to bribe the praetorians to support and consolidate his bid for the throne. The Praetorians abandoned Nero, accepted Galba and the legions followed; the senate also accepted his bid. The Senate declared Nero a public enemy and imposed a damnatio memoriae upon him: a damnatio memoriae is a condemnation of one’s memory; any portraits, inscriptions and writings that document the acta or deeds of the object of the damnatio memoriae, were destroyed.
13)	Nero failed to persuade the tribunes and centurions of the Praetorian Guard to accompany him, but it was only after he was believed to have left Rome that the Prefect, Nymphidius Sabinus brought the Guard to declare for Galba. (Suet. Nero 47; 48. 2; Plut. Galba 2. 2; 14, 2; Tacitus Hist. 1. 5). Tigellinus, now ill and playing a subordinate role to Sabinus, had already secured his safety by ingratiating himself with Galba’s legate Titus Vinius, but after Sabinus’ declaration for Galba, Vinius too declared for Galba (Tac. Hist. 1. 72, 1-2). And it was only after both Sabinus’ and Tigellinus’ declarations for Galba that the Senate finally declared Nero a public enemy and conferred upon Galba the powers making him officially Princeps ( Suet. Nero 49· 2; Plut. Galba 7· 2; Dio 63. 29, 1).
14)	Nero was by now a hunted outlaw hiding out in the villa of his freedman, Phaon, outside Rome with other (freedmen) attendants. With the help of (his freedman secretary) Epaphroditus, Nero finally managed to stab himself to death just as the praetorians were arriving. His artistic inclinations prevailed to the end: it was while he was ordering his grave to be decorated with whatever marble could be found, that he uttered his famous last words, lamenting “Qualis artifex pereo!” (What an artist dies in me). He had extracted a promise from his servants that they would not allow his body to be mutilated. His body was tended and buried by three women who had been close to him in his younger days (friends of his mistress Acte; Suet. Nero 49. 1 and 4).
15)	Legacy Nero's popularity among the lower classes and the Greeks remained even after his death. Nero’s close friend, and the successor of Galba, Otho,* paid him all public honors, but he was nevertheless, disgraced and subjected to the damnatio memoriae. He was not (obviously!) deified
16)	In sum, during the reigns of the Julio-Claudians, Rome reached its height of power and wealth. It was a golden age of Roman literature and arts, but also a period of imperial extravagance and scandals. The system of hereditary succession, the excessive court, and imperial patronage created conflicts of interest and duty. The Julio-Claudians cherished the memory of the Republic, but they alienated the Senate, and they diminished the old Roman nobility. The practice of endogamy (marriage within bloodlines) had led to interfamilial competition, as well as strife and murder, if we believe Tacitus. The autocracy of the emperor increased with each reign, and the sources have left a tradition of abuse of privilege by the successors of Augustus.

Chapter 14: Year of the Four Emperors 
1)	Galba and Otho
a)	Year of the Four Emperors (AD 68-69)
2)	The Year of the Four Emperors: AD June 68 - December 69 The aftermath of Nero’s death was disastrous; it created a void that led to a year of civil war, known as the Year of the Four Emperors. Four emperors ruled: Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. Vespasian “won,” and became first ruler of the Flavian Dynasty. The military and political upheavals of the civil war also led to two revolts:
a)	The Jewish Revolt, already in progress in the last year of Nero’s reign. 
b)	 The Batavian Rebellion, which started just after Nero’s death
3)	Tacitus (Histories I. 4)* shares a secret that an emperor could be made elsewhere than in Rome. I.e. emperors could be proclaimed (by troops) in the provinces, which was the case in the Year of the Four Emperors. “Before, however, I begin the work that I have planned, I think that we should turn back and consider the condition of the city, the temper of the armies, the attitude of the provinces, the elements of strength and weakness in the entire world, that we may understand not only the incidents and the issues of events, which for the most part are due to chance, but also their reasons and causes. Although Nero's death had at first been welcomed with outbursts of joy, it roused varying emotions, not only in the city among the senators and people, and the city soldiery, but also among all the legions and generals; for the secret of empire was now revealed, that an emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome. The senators rejoiced and immediately made full use of their liberty, as was natural, for they had to do with a new emperor who was still absent. The leading members of the equestrian class were nearly as elated as the senators. The respectable part of the common people and those attached to the great houses, the clients and freedmen of those who had been condemned and driven into exile, were all roused to hope. The lowest classes, addicted to the circus and theatre, and with them, the basest slaves, as well as those men who had wasted their property and, to their shame, were wont to depend on Nero’s bounty, were cast down and grasped at every rumor.” * Written before the Annals; it covers the fall of Nero to the end of the reign of Domitian and Flavians
4)	The civil war ended with the victory of the fourth contender for the throne, Titus Flavius Vespasianus. Vespasian established the Flavian Dynasty. The Julio-Claudian Dynasty had come to an end.
5)	Servius Sulpicius Galba (Tac. Hist.1.1-49) 
a)	 Ruled from June 68 to January 69 Galba had been backed by Julius Vindex. Although he was a senatorial man, at first the senate had to declare him a public enemy, since Vindex had revolted against Nero. Galba was first supported by the Praetorians, whom he had bribed; following this, he was recognized and ratified as emperor by a “relieved” senate.
b)	 Galba ruled for only a few months. Although from a senatorial family, Galba was old (70’s), and had little or no currency with the armies and the masses. He was also cruel: on his march to Rome, he abused towns that resisted him, imposed fines and allowed his men to loot and to destroy towns.
c)	Out of touch in Rome, Galba was hated by the masses because he was not generous with the grain dole. The legions of Upper Germany also hated Galba because he had recalled Verginius Rufus to Rome, regarding the popular commander as a real threat to his position. The legions had acclaimed Rufus* (their legate) as emperor, while Galba was securing his bid for the throne.
d)	Galba might have saved himself had he adopted Verginius Rufus as heir. However, he adopted another (old) senator, Calpurnius Piso Licinianus. This move offended the German and Spanish legions, and it prompted Marcus Salvius Otho* to make a bid in Rome for throne. Now Otho bribed the praetorians, and they murdered Galba and elevated Otho (Tac. Hist.1.50-90)
6)	Otho: equestrian, former friends of Nero ( and husband of Nero’s second wife Poppaea Sabina) 
a)	Otho ruled from January to April 69. He was recognised as emperor by a Senate with reasonable hopes and expectations, but his days were numbered. Even before Otho was sworn in, Vitellius, began his march from Germany* to Rome to make his bid for throne. Vitellius had already been acclaimed by the disaffected German legions, while Galba had been on the throne (!)
b)	Otho tried to avoid another civil war and sent emissaries to propose a peace. He even invited Vitellius to rule with him as co-regent. However, an early spring prevented Otho from blocking Vitellius’ forces at the Alpine passes into Italy.
c)	A conflict erupted in north Italy, known as the First Battle of Bedriacum (April 69). After a minor victory (in Gaul), Otho rushed into battle with his legions without waiting for reinforcements, and having been defeated, he committed suicide (Tac. Hist. II. 1-51).
d)	This gold coin (aureas) was issued by Vitellius following his victory at Bedriacum.

Defeated Vitellius in the Second Battle of Bedriacum (69) aka the Sack of Cremona. Vitellius was executed in Rome by Flavian forces in December of 69.
14b. Vitellius and Vespasian
1)	Vitellius April 69- December 69
a)	Vitellius was recognized as emperor by shaken Senate. Vitellius set out for Rome to claim throne. 
b)	 Suetonius (Vitellius) portrays Vitellius as a tyrant and a thug, cruel and tyrannical and soon the object of conspiracies. He reports Vitellius’ over-indulgences drove the treasury into bankruptcy. Suetonius describes Vitellius as tall and fat, with a big paunch, double chin and the fleshy face of Nero. Note in this veristic portrait, the emphatic nasolabial creases, that come with age and obesity. Vitellius’ no-nonsense military hairstyle was probably intended for his military constituency. Tac Hist. II .52-101 reign of Vitellius
c)	Suetonius Vitellius 13-14 on his appetite and his cruelty 13.1 “But his besetting sins were luxury and cruelty. He divided his feasts into three, sometimes into four a day, breakfast, luncheon, dinner, and a drinking bout; and he was readily able to do justice to all of them through his habit of taking emetics. Moreover, he had himself invited to each of these meals by different men on the same day, and the materials for any one of them never cost less than four hundred thousand sesterces. 2. Most notorious of all was the dinner given by his brother to celebrate the emperor's arrival in Rome, at which two thousand of the choicest fishes and seven thousand birds are said to have been served. He himself eclipsed even this at the dedication of a platter, which on account of its huge size he called the “Shield of Minerva, Defender of the City.” In this he mingled the livers of pike, the brains of pheasants and peacocks, the tongues of flamingoes and the milt of lampreys, brought by his captains and triremes from the whole empire, from Parthia to the Spanish strait. 3. Being besides a man of an appetite that was not only boundless, but also regardless of time or decency, he could never refrain, even when he sacrificing or making a journey, from snatching bits of meat and cakes amid the altars, almost from the fire, and devouring them on the spot; and in the cook shops along the road, viands smoking hot or even those left over from the day before and partly consumed. 14. 1 He delighted in inflicting death and torture on anyone whatsoever, and for any cause whatever, putting to death several men of rank, fellow students and comrades of his, whom he had solicited to come to court by every kind of deception, all but offering them a share in the rule. This he did in various treacherous ways, even giving poison to one of them with his own hand in a glass of cold water, for which the man had called when ill of a fever.”
2)	Vespasian’s path to power: Jewish Revolt In AD 66 Nero mandated Vespasian to settle the revolt in Judaea. In spring of AD 67 Vespasian subdued and cut off Jerusalem. By October Galilee was pacified and plans for the strategic investment of Jerusalem were formed. In 69 Vespasian handed the command off to his son Titus* and began his bid for the throne. *Titus completed the campaign in AD 70 in what is known as the First Jewish War.
3)	Vespasian (Suetonius Vespasian 1-5) Flavius Vespasianus was born in AD 9 to a family of equestrian entrepreneurs and tax collectors in the Sabine hill country north of Rome. He rose to prominence in the Roman Army, gaining distinction in Claudius’ invasion of Britain in AD 43-44 and subsequently won a consulship in AD 51. He fell from imperial favor in the reign of Nero for having fallen asleep during one of Nero’s musical performances. However, following a revolt in Judaea which had led to the the massacre, by a Jewish faction, of a local Roman garrison in AD 66, Nero sent Vespasian with three legions to crush the revolt, and his early success led to his restoration in Nero’s imperial court.
4)	Vespasian and Mucianus (Tac. Hist. II. 67-101) The revolts of Vindex and Galba had brought Nero’s reign to collapse. After the death of Galba, Vespasian had sworn allegiance to Otho; as Galba, Otho and Vitellius rose to power and fell from power, civil war and chaos raged in the western Empire. While Vespasian was occupied with the campaigns in Judaea against Jerusalem, he had sworn allegiance to each of these emperors, including Vitellius. However, shortly after Vitellius assumed power in the spring of AD 69, following his victory over Otho in the Second Battle of Bedriacum, the Legate (military governor) of Syria, Gaius Licinius Mucianus (who had also supported Galba and Otho) persuaded Vespasian to take up arms against Vitellius.
5)	In addition, the two men met at the border of Judaea and Syria and decided to revolt to launch Vespasian’s bid for the throne. In fact, Vespasian had been sent out to the east assume the command in Judaea from Mucianus, because he (Mucianus) had failed to suppress the revolt. It was through his son Titus, who was also campaigning in Judaea, that Vespasian gained the friendship and (military) support of Mucianus, who helped him (with his legions) win his bid for the throne (of course it would have been in his interest politically, having been relieved of his command, and subsequently he was rewarded by Vespasian for his loyalty in AD 72 with his third consulship). They agreed that Mucianus would strike first at Vitellius in Rome, while Vespasian settled affairs in the east; Vespasian’s son, Titus would remain in Judaea to complete the campaigns in what came to be known as the First Jewish War.

They agreed that Mucianus would strike first at Vitellius in Rome, while Vespasian settled affairs in the east; Vespasian’s son, Titus would remain in Judaea to complete the campaigns in what came to be known as the First Jewish War.
7)	In the summer of 69 the legions in the East and eventually the Danube declared for Vespasian On July 1st Tiberius Alexander, the prefect of Egypt, and the legions of Alexandria declared for Vespasian. On July 3 rd the legions of (Mucianus) in Judaea declared for Vespasian. By August the legions (of Mucianus) in Syria declared for Vespasian. Vespasian dispatched Mucianus to Italy with 20,000 troops; then he set out from Syria to Alexandria to take control of the grain shipments (to starve Rome and Italy into submission), in a war of attrition. However, in the early fall of 69 the lastminute declaration of support by the Danubian legions and their invasion of Italy without waiting for the Syrian legions of Mucianus led to a quick victory for Vespasian and a blood bath in Rome.
8)	By October AD 69 the Danubian legions had defeated Vitellius’ army near Cremona in what is known as the Second Battle of Bedriacum (aka the Sack of Cremona). By mid-December the Danubian forces were 95 km north of Rome, and with no further hope of reinforcements, Vitellius’ forces surrendered. Vitellius had no support, now because of the Batavian Revolt (see below); Vespasian’s interference in this matter kept Vitellius’ legions away from Rome.
9)	At Rome Vitellius was in peril. On December 20th the Danubian army entered Rome, and by that afternoon Vitellius was dead (Tac. Hist. III. 63-86 ).
10)	Suetonius Vitellius 17-18 1. “The foremost of the army had now forced their way in, and since no one opposed them, were ransacking everything in the usual way. They dragged Vitellius from his hiding-place and when they asked him his name (for they did not know him) and if he knew where Vitellius was, he tried to escape them by a lie. Being soon recognised, he did not cease to beg that he be confined for a time, even in the prison, alleging that he had something to say of importance to the safety of Vespasian. But they bound his arms behind his back, put a noose about his neck, and dragged him with rent garments and half-naked to the Forum. All along the Sacred Way he was greeted with mockery and abuse, his head held back by the hair, as is common with criminals, and even the point of a sword placed under his chin, so that he could not look down but must let his face be seen. 2 Some pelted him with dung and ordure, others called him incendiary and glutton, and some of the mob even taunted him with his bodily defects. He was in fact abnormally tall, with a face usually flushed from hard drinking, a huge belly, and one thigh crippled from being struck once upon a time by a four-horse chariot, when he was in attendance on Gaius as he was driving. At last on the Stairs of Wailing he was tortured for a long time and then despatched and dragged off with a hook to the Tiber. 18 1 He met his death, along with his brother and his son, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, fulfilling the prediction of those who had declared from an omen which befell him at Vienna, as we have stated, that he was destined to fall into the power of some man of Gaul. For he was slain by Antonius Primus, a leader of the opposing faction, who was born at Tolosa and in his youth bore the surname Becco, which means a rooster's beak.”

14)	Civil War and Barbarian Mercenaries, a dangerous combination: The Batavian Revolt 69-70 (Tac. Hist. IV. 1-37; 54-79). In Germania Inferior, German Batavians and other tribes in Germania Magna and Gaul had been rebelling against Rome. Under Gaius Julius Civilis, a Batavian auxiliary officer, the Batavi destroyed two legions and defeated the Roman army.
15)	The revolts had been neutralized by the Romans (earlier). But the disruptions of the year of civil war had caused them to resurface. Vitellius, and then Vespasian promoted Civilis and the Batavi for their own respective ambitions. Each used them as barbarian “mercenaries” to fight against the Roman legions of their rivals: I.e., each supported Civilis and the Batavi to weaken the legions, and the power base of his adversary.
16)	Vitellius and Batavians: Vitellius supported Civilis in early 69 because he needed Batavi military support against Otho. Batavian regiments helped Vitellius overthrow Otho in the First Battle of Bedriacum. However, Vitellius ordered his generals in Germania Inferior to raise more troops from the Batavians, which contravened a previous treaty with the Batavi, setting a maximum number of recruitable men. 
17)	Vespasian and Batavians When Vespasian fought Vitellius for the throne, he supported Civilis to prevent him from acquiring support from the legions on the Rhine. Vespasian even promised the Batavians independence, which he (of course) repudiated (!)
18)	In sum, the brutality and corruption of Roman recruiting policies provoked a larger rebellion, and the entire Batavi nation revolted against Rome.
19)	Treating Barbarian Auxilliaries Badly When Vespasian was elevated to throne, Civilis did not stop attacking Roman legions. Consequently, Vespasian mandated Petillius Cerialis* to neutralize Civilis and the Batavians. Following “peace talks” the Batavians submitted to Roman authority under harsh and humiliating conditions, and they were forced to relocate. A legion was stationed permanently on their territory.
